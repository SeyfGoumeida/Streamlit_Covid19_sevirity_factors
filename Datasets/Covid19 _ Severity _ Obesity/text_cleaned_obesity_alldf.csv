0,35502514,"INTRODUCTION: It is not clear whether asthma, the most frequent chronic disease in childhood, is a risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pediatric population and how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the lung functions in these patients. PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the course and the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection among children with asthma and determine the risk factors for the decline in lung function tests METHODS: In this retrospective study, asthmatic children with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were compared with a random control group of asthmatic patients without COVID-19. In addition, the clinical course and the effect on lung function tests of COVID-19 among children with asthma were also evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine patients who had COVID-19, and 792 who did not were included in the study. Fever, fatigue, and cough were the most frequent symptoms during COVID-19. Regarding the severity of COVID-19, 163 patients (87.6%) had a mild clinical condition, 13 (7%) had moderate disease, one (0.5%) had severe disease and two had (1.1%) critically ill disease. Two patients were diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), one patient suffered from pneumothorax. Lung function tests of the patients before and after COVID-19 infection were analyzed; no significant differences were found in FEV1 % (91.7% vs 90.9%, p=0.513), FVC% (89.8% vs 90.8%, p=0.502) and FEV1/FVC (103.1% vs 100.6%, p=0.056), while FEF25-75% values (107.6% vs 98.4%, p<0.001) were significantly lower after the COVID-19 infection. Obesity [OR: 3.785, 95%CI: 1.152-12.429, P =0.028] and having a family history of atopy [OR:3.359, 95%CI:1.168-9.657, P = 0.025] were found to be the independent risk factors for >/=25% decrease in FEF25-75 after COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection leads to dysfunction of the small airways in asthmatic children and obesity is an independent risk factor for >/=25% decrease in FEF25-75. The long-term effects of COVID-19 infection especially on small airways require close monitoring in children with asthma. This article is protected by copyright.

It is observed that 75% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have at least one COVID-19 associated comorbidity. It was shown that people with underlying chronic illnesses are more likely to get it and grow seriously ill. Individuals with COVID-19 who have a past medical history of cardiovascular disorder, cancer, obesity, chronic lung disease, diabetes, or neurological disease had the worst prognosis and are more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome or pneumonia. COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person's immune system, age and comorbidities. Symptoms can range from mild, such as cough, shortness of breath and fever, to critical disease, including respiratory failure, shock and multi-organ system failure. So, COVID-19 infection can cause overall worsening of these previous respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, etc. This review aims to provide information on the impact of the COVID-19 disease on pre-existing lung comorbidities.","On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic.

3,35464048,"Background . Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Among the risk factors associated with the severity of this disease is the presence of several metabolic disorders. For this reason, the aim of this research was to identify the comorbidities and laboratory parameters among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), comparing the patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with those who did not require IMV, in order to determine the clinical characteristics associated with the COVID-19 severity. Methods. We carried out a cross-sectional study among 152 patients who were admitted to the ICU from April 1 (st) to July 31 (st), 2021, in whom the comorbidities and laboratory parameters associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection severity were identified. The data of these patients was grouped into two main groups: ""patients who required IMV"" and ""patients who did not require IMV"". The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test for continuous data and the chi 2 test for categorical data were used to compare the variables between both groups. Results. Of the 152 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the ICU, 66 required IMV and 86 did not require IMV. Regarding the comorbidities found in these patients, a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension and obesity was observed among patients who required IMV vs. those who did not require IMV ( p<0.05). Concerning laboratory parameters, only glucose, Interleukin 6 (IL-6), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher among patients who required IMV than in those who did not require IMV ( p<0.05). Conclusion. This study performed in a Mexican population indicates that comorbidities such as: T2DM, hypertension and obesity, as well as elevated levels of glucose, IL-6, LDH and CRP are associated with the COVID-19 severity.","Background .

4,35457123,"Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and ensuing inflammation pose a huge challenge to the host's nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) metabolism. Humans depend on vitamin B3 for biosynthesis of NAD(+), indispensable for many metabolic and NAD(+)-consuming signaling reactions. The balance between its utilization and resynthesis is vitally important. Many extra-pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 strikingly resemble those of pellagra, vitamin B3 deficiency (e.g., diarrhoea, dermatitis, oral cavity and tongue manifestations, loss of smell and taste, mental confusion). In most developed countries, pellagra is successfully eradicated by vitamin B3 fortification programs. Thus, conceivably, it has not been suspected as a cause of COVID-19 symptoms. Here, the deregulation of the NAD(+) metabolism in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is reviewed, with special emphasis on the differences in the NAD(+) biosynthetic pathway's efficiency in conditions predisposing for the development of serious COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced NAD(+) depletion and the elevated levels of its metabolites contribute to the development of a systemic disease. Acute liberation of nicotinamide (NAM) in antiviral NAD(+)-consuming reactions potentiates ""NAM drain"", cooperatively mediated by nicotinamide N-methyltransferase and aldehyde oxidase. ""NAM drain"" compromises the NAD(+) salvage pathway's fail-safe function. The robustness of the host's NAD(+) salvage pathway, prior to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, is an important determinant of COVID-19 severity and persistence of certain symptoms upon resolution of infection.","Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and ensuing inflammation pose a huge challenge to the host's nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) metabolism.

5,35456343,"AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of our review is to indicate and discuss the impact of cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes, lipid profile, hypertension and smoking on the course and mortality of COVID-19 infection. BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is spreading around the world and becoming a major public health crisis. All coronaviruses are known to affect the cardiovascular system. There is a strong correlation between cardiovascular risk factors and severe clinical complications, including death in COVID-19 patients. All the above-mentioned risk factors are widespread and constitute a significant worldwide health problem. Some of them are modifiable and the awareness of their connection with the COVID-19 progress may have a crucial impact on the current and possible upcoming infection. DATA COLLECTION: We searched for research papers describing the impact of selected cardiovascular risk factors on the course, severity, complications and mortality of COVID-19 infection form PubMed and Google Scholar databases.

The publications were selected according to the time of their publications between January 2020 and December 2021. From the PubMed database we obtain 1552 results. Further studies were sought by manually searching reference lists of the relevant articles. Relevant articles were selected based on their title, abstract or full text. Articles were excluded if they were clearly related to another subject matter or were not published in English. The types of articles are mainly randomized controlled trial and systematic review. An additional criterion used by researchers was co-morbidities and age of patients in study groups. From a review of the publications, 105 of them were selected for this work with all subheadings included. Findings and Results: The intention of this review was to summarize current knowledge about comorbidities and development of COVID-19 infection. We tried to focus on the course and mortality of the abovementioned virus disease in patients with concomitant CV risk factors. Unfortunately, we were unable to assess the quality of data in screened papers and studies we choose because of the heterogenicity of the groups. The conducted studies had different endpoints and included different groups of patients in terms of nationality, age, race and clinical status. We decide to divide the main subjects of the research into separately described subtitles such as obesity, lipid profile, hypertension, diabetes, smoking. We believe that the studies we included and gathered are very interesting and show modern and present-day clinical data and approaches to COVID-19 infection in specific divisions of patients.","AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of our review is to indicate and discuss the impact of cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes, lipid profile, hypertension and smoking on the course and mortality of COVID-19 infection.

6,35448480,"The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor has been identified as the entry receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is abundantly expressed in many organs. With respect to the role of circulating ACE2 and its receptor expression in the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is still debated whether diseases such as hypertension or pharmacotherapies, including ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers that affect ACE2 receptor expression, may modulate the severity and outcome of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We therefore tested the hypothesis that treatment with the ACE inhibitor Ramipril affects organ-specific ACE2 receptor mRNA and protein expression as well as the serum metabolome in BioBreeding (BB) rats. Twelve male BioBreeding rats were randomly divided into a Ramipril (10 mg/kg body weight) treatment group or a control group (N = 12; n = 6 per group) over a period of seven days. Ramipril treatment resulted in the reduction of acylcarnitines (C3-C6) out of 64 metabolites. Among the different organs studied, only in the lungs did Ramipril treatment significantly increase both Ace2 mRNA and ACE2 receptor membrane protein levels. Increased ACE2 receptor lung expression after Ramipril treatment was not associated with differences in ACE2 serum concentrations between experimental groups. Our data provide experimental in vivo evidence that the ACE inhibitor Ramipril selectively increases pulmonary ACE2 receptor mRNA and protein levels and reduces acylcarnitines.","The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor has been identified as the entry receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is abundantly expressed in many organs. With respect to the role of circulating ACE2 and its receptor expression in the pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is still debated whether diseases such as hypertension or pharmacotherapies, including ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers that affect ACE2 receptor expression, may modulate the severity and outcome of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We therefore tested the hypothesis that treatment with the ACE inhibitor Ramipril affects organ-specific ACE2 receptor mRNA and protein expression as well as the serum metabolome in BioBreeding (BB) rats.

7,35445260,"BACKGROUND: To summarize modifiable factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suggested by Mendelian randomization studies. METHODS: In this systematic review, we searched PubMed, EMBASE and MEDLINE, from inception to 15 November 2021, for Mendelian randomization studies in English. We selected studies that assessed associations of genetically predicted exposures with COVID-19-related outcomes (severity, hospitalization and susceptibility). Risk of bias of the included studies was evaluated based on the consideration of the three main assumptions for instrumental variable analyses. RESULTS: We identified 700 studies through systematic search, of which 50 Mendelian randomization studies were included. Included studies have explored a wide range of socio-demographic factors, lifestyle attributes, anthropometrics and biomarkers, predisposition to diseases and druggable targets in COVID-19 risk. Mendelian randomization studies suggested that increases in smoking, obesity and inflammatory factors were associated with higher risk of COVID-19. Predisposition to ischaemic stroke, combined bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder, chronic kidney disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was potentially associated with higher COVID-19 risk. Druggable targets, such as higher protein expression of histo-blood group ABO system transferase (ABO), interleukin (IL)-6 and lower protein expression of 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) were associated with higher risk of COVID-19. There was no strong genetic evidence supporting the role of vitamin D, glycaemic traits and predisposition to cardiometabolic diseases in COVID-19 risk. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes modifiable factors for intervention (e.g. smoking, obesity and inflammatory factors) and proteomic signatures (e.g. OAS1 and IL-6) that could help identify drugs for treating COVID-19.","BACKGROUND: To summarize modifiable factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suggested by Mendelian randomization studies.

8,35443508,"Mucormycosis is an angioinvasive disease caused by mold fungi of the genus Rhizopus, Mucor. India has reported surge in cases of COVID 19 associated Mucormycosis over the past few months due to the increasing frequency of risk factors like corticosteroid therapy, uncontrolled diabetes, neutropenia and obesity. Studies have shown that eukaryote cell membrane contains cholesterol and fungal cell wall contains ergosterol with lanosterol being precursor for both and ergosterol is essential for mitochondrial DNA maintenance in fungi, as cholesterol is in humans. The current study is based on the hypothesis that fungi can use human cholesterol as a raw material to maintain its cell function and accentuate its own multiplication and this can indirectly be shown by the association between deranged lipid parameters in an individual with severity of Mucormycosis. Thus present study aims to estimate the lipid parameters and correlate the serum lipid parameters with clinical profile, stage of the disease and duration of onset of mucormycosis in patients with COVID associated Mucormycosis. MATERIAL: This is a cross sectional study conducted on 103 patients diagnosed with COVID 19 associated mucormycosis admitted to the hospitals attached to BMCRI from July 2021 to September 2021. Serum fasting lipid profile and other biochemical parameters were determined. The correlation of lipid levels with clinical profile, onset and staging of mucormycosis patients were obtained. OBSERVATION: The age distribution varied from 22yrs to 75yrs of whom majority were males (83.4%). Among patients with mucormycosis of all severity stages, nasal block (79.6%) was found to be most common symptom followed by headache(75.7%). Among patients with mucormycosis most frequent associated comorbidity was Diabetes mellitus (DM) followed by hypertension (HTN) followed by DM and HTN followed by Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) followed by DM,HTN and IHD. The study showed statistically significant correlation such that severity of mucormycosis increased with progressive worsening lipid parameters. It also showed statistically significant correlation such that patients with increasing TC,LDL,VLDL,TG levels had shorter COVID 19 onset to mucormycosis onset duration. CONCLUSION: The study showed a positive correlation between serum lipid profile and staging of mucormycosis and negative correlation between lipid levels with duration between onset of COVID 19 to onset of mucormycosis. Hence serum lipid profile can be used as an excellent marker to predict the severity and prognosis of COVID 19 associated mucormycosis.","Mucormycosis is an angioinvasive disease caused by mold fungi of the genus Rhizopus, Mucor.

This article aimed to describe patients admitted to a large district hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, during the first wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infections. To compare the clinical features and further investigate survivors and deceased COVID-19 patients. Methods: A single centre retrospective review of clinical records and laboratory data of patients admitted with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from April 2020 to August 2020. Results: A total of 568 patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were admitted to the study centre for one night or longer and of these patients 154 (27%) died of COVID-19. The median age of patients who died of COVID-19 was 66 years and 53 years for survivors. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus and obesity were the commonest comorbidities in patients who survived and died of COVID-19. There were no major differences when comparing the severity of infiltrates on chest X-rays (CXR) of COVID-19 survivors with deceased patients. More than half (58%) of deceased patients died within 3 days following admission to hospital. A substantial number of patients who died of COVID-19 had associated acute kidney injury (n = 79, 51%).

METHODS: This case series retrospective analyzed, from June to November, 2020, ten patients admitted to the emergency department, with positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV-2, presenting with neurological symptoms and positive findings at brain imaging studies. RESULTS: In this sample, the clinical severity of the symptoms varied from mild to critical. Ischemic stroke was observed in four patients, hemorrhagic events occurred in five cases. Three patients evolved with large parenchymal hemorrhage, and one presented petechial bleeding foci. In one case, we observed subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with bilateral hypodensity in both globus pallidus. Typical posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome findings were observed in one patient on brain computed tomography. CONCLUSION: Patients with neurovascular complications related to COVID-19 had positive findings in brain imaging and neurological symptoms. The pathological entities observed drew attention to the neurological risk of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including worse outcomes in individuals whose medical history includes clinical comorbidities, especially hypertension and obesity.","OBJECTIVE: To describe cerebrovascular manifestations in patients hospitalized for treatment of severe COVID-19, highlighting the comorbidities observed, and those that may play a relevant role as risk factors for severe outcomes.

METHODS: All patients, consecutively admitted to our COVID ICU, where age was not used as an admission criterion, from March 2020 through April 2021, were included. Demographics, clinical and laboratory characteristics were recorded. Illness severity and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) were calculated. Patients>/=70 years old were compared to youngers. RESULTS: Of 458 patients [68 (59-76) years, 70% males], 206 (45%) were>/=70 years old. Compared to younger, older patients had higher illness severity scores [APACHE II 18 (14-23) versus 12 (9-16), p<0.001, SOFA 8 (6-10) versus 6 (2-8), p<0.001, CCI 5 (4-6) versus 2 (1-3), p <0.001], increased need for mechanical ventilation (92% vs 72%, p<0.001) and ICU mortality (74% versus. 29%, p<0.001).

12,35396748,"INTRODUCTION: Interest revolving around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reinfection is escalating rapidly. By definition, reinfection denotes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), PCR redetection, and COVID-19 recurrence within three months of the initial symptoms. The main aim of the current systematic review was to evaluate the features of COVID-19 relapse patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this study, we used a string of terms developed by a skilled librarian and through a systematical search in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for eligible studies. Clinical surveys of any type were included from January 2019 to March 2021. Eligible studies consisted of two positive assessments separated by a negative result via RT-PCR. RESULTS: Fifty-four studies included 207 cases of COVID-19 reinfection. Children were less likely to have COVID-19 relapse. However, the most patients were in the age group of 20-40 years. Asthenia (66.6%), headache (66.6%), and cough (54.7%) were prevalent symptoms in the first SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asthenia (62.9%), myalgia (62.9%), and headache (61.1%) were most frequent in the second one. The most common treatment options used in first COVID-19 infection were lopinavir/ritonavir (80%), oxygen support (69.2%), and oseltamivir (66.6). However, for the treatment of second infection, mostly antibiotics (100%), dexamethasone (100%), and remdesivir (80%) were used. In addition, obesity (32.5%), kidney failure (30.7%), and hypertension (30.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Unfortunately, approximately 4.5% of patients died. CONCLUSION: We found the potency of COVID-19 recurrence as an outstanding issue. This feature should be regarded in the COVID-19 management. Furthermore, the first and second COVID-19 are similar in clinical features. For clinically practical comparison of the symptoms severity between two epochs of infection, uniform data of both are required. We suggest that future studies undertake a homogenous approach to establish the clinical patterns of the reinfection phenomena.","INTRODUCTION: Interest revolving around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reinfection is escalating rapidly.

However, for the treatment of second infection, mostly antibiotics (100%), dexamethasone (100%), and remdesivir (80%) were used. In addition, obesity (32.5%), kidney failure (30.7%), and hypertension (30.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Unfortunately, approximately 4.5% of patients died. CONCLUSION: We found the potency of COVID-19 recurrence as an outstanding issue. This feature should be regarded in the COVID-19 management. Furthermore, the first and second COVID-19 are similar in clinical features. For clinically practical comparison of the symptoms severity between two epochs of infection, uniform data of both are required.

13,35393674,"The interim results of the large, multinational trials on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using a combination of antiviral drugs appear to have little to no effect on the 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course. Therefore, there is a still vivid interest in finding alternate re-purposed drugs and nutrition supplements, which can halt or slow the disease severity. We review here the multiple preclinical studies, partially supported by clinical evidence showing the quercetin's possible therapeutic/prophylaxis efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as well as comorbidities like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus, obesity, coagulopathy, and hypertension. Currently, 14 interventional clinical trials are underway assessing the efficacy of quercetin along with other antiviral drugs/nutritional supplements as prophylaxis/treatment option against COVID-19. The present review is tempting to suggest that, based on circumstantial scientific evidence and preliminary clinical data, the flavonoid quercetin can ameliorate COVID-19 infection and symptoms acting in concert on two parallel and independent paths: inhibiting key factors responsible for SARS-CoV-2 infections and mitigating the clinical manifestations of the disease in patients with comorbid conditions. Despite the broad therapeutic properties of quercetin, further high power randomized clinical trials are needed to firmly establish its clinical efficacy against COVID-19.","The interim results of the large, multinational trials on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using a combination of antiviral drugs appear to have little to no effect on the 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course.

METHODS: Data from a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients treated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center between March 8, 2020, and January 25, 2021, was analyzed. Sociodemographic characteristics and pre-existing conditions were extracted from electronic medical records. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models identified associated risk factors, and a regression causal mediation analysis examined the role of diabetes in the association between obesity and illness severity. All analyses were stratified by age (<65 and >/=65). RESULTS: Among individuals <65yo, diabetes accounted for 19-30% of the associations between obesity and COVID-19 illness severity. Among patients >/=65yo, having a BMI <18.5 was a risk factor for mortality regardless of diabetes history. CONCLUSION: Our findings have clinical implications in documenting which patients may be at elevated risk for adverse outcomes. More in-depth prospective studies are needed to capture how glycemic regulation may influence prognosis.","OBJECTIVE: This study examines the value of risk stratification by documented diagnosis of diabetes and objectively measured height and weight (BMI) in COVID-19 severity and mortality in a large sample of patients in an urban hospital located in Southern California.

15,35386177,"Even after two years of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, despite known risk factors, we are still unable to predict the severity of the infection in specific patients. Due to the contradictory data, the protective role of immunosuppression in preventing the severe course of the infection remains uncertain. Therefore, we want to discuss the influence of several immunosuppressive factors on the COVID-19 pattern in children, based on two case reports regarding 17-year-old boys with other immunosuppressive factors and a completely different course of the disease. The first patient suffered from AIDS, syphilis and primary central nervous system B-cell lymphoma, treated with radiotherapy. He experienced a light path of the infection, presenting only periodically appearing cough with no X-ray inflammatory changes. Nevertheless, due to the risk of severe COVID-19 and transient hypoxia, remdesivir was administered. He remained in a generally good condition and his follow-up did not reveal any noticeable complications. The second patient was characterised by Down syndrome, obesity, polyarteritis nodosa and chronic immunosuppressive therapy. He developed massive pneumonia, required treatment in the intensive care unit with the use of mechanical ventilation, remdesivir and anakinra. Despite the initial improvement of his general condition, including the degree of lung involvement and respiratory function, he developed an intracerebral haemorrhage, leading to brain herniation and ultimately death. In conclusion, HIV infection, oncological and immunosuppressive treatment do not seem to predispose to the severe course of COVID-19, whereas Down syndrome and obesity do.","Even after two years of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, despite known risk factors, we are still unable to predict the severity of the infection in specific patients.

16,35351135,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection portends a broad range of outcomes, from a majority of asymptomatic cases to a lethal disease. Robust correlates of severe COVID-19 include old age, male sex, poverty, and co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. A precise knowledge of the molecular and biological mechanisms that may explain the association of severe disease with male sex is still lacking. Here, we analyzed the relationship of serum testosterone levels and the immune cell skewing with disease severity in male COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Biochemical and hematological parameters of admission samples in 497 hospitalized male and female COVID-19 patients, analyzed for associations with outcome and sex. Longitudinal (in-hospital course) analyses of a subcohort of 114 male patients were analyzed for associations with outcome. Longitudinal analyses of immune populations by flow cytometry in 24 male patients were studied for associations with outcome. RESULTS: We have found quantitative differences in biochemical predictors of disease outcome in male vs. female patients. Longitudinal analyses in a subcohort of male COVID-19 patients identified serum testosterone trajectories as the strongest predictor of survival (AUC of ROC = 92.8%, p < 0.0001) in these patients among all biochemical parameters studied, including single-point admission serum testosterone values. In lethal cases, longitudinal determinations of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and androstenedione levels did not follow physiological feedback patterns. Failure to reinstate physiological testosterone levels was associated with evidence of impaired T helper differentiation and augmented circulating classical monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery or failure to reinstate testosterone levels is strongly associated with survival or death, respectively, from COVID-19 in male patients. Our data suggest an early inhibition of the central LH-androgen biosynthesis axis in a majority of patients, followed by full recovery in survivors or a peripheral failure in lethal cases. These observations are suggestive of a significant role of testosterone status in the immune responses to COVID-19 and warrant future experimental explorations of mechanistic relationships between testosterone status and SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes, with potential prophylactic or therapeutic implications.","BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection portends a broad range of outcomes, from a majority of asymptomatic cases to a lethal disease.

17,35350707,"Background: There is an enormous knowledge gap on management strategies, clinical outcomes, and follow-up after kidney transplantation (KT) in recipients that have recovered from coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods: We conducted a multi-center, retrospective analysis in 23 Indian transplant centres between June 26, 2020 to December 1, 2021 on KT recipients who recovered after COVID-19 infections. We analyzed clinical and biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (AR) incidence and used cox-proportional modeling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for predictors of AR. We also performed competing risk analysis. Additional outcome measures included graft loss, all-cause mortality, waiting time from a positive real-time polymerase test (RT-PCR) to KT, laboratory parameters, and quality of life in follow-up. Findings: Among 372 KT which included 38(10.21%) ABO-incompatible, 12(3.22%) sensitized, 64(17.20%) coexisting donors with COVID-19 history and 20 (5.37%) recipients with residual radiographic abnormalities, the incidence of AR was 34 (9.1%) with 1(0.26%) death censored graft loss, and 4(1.07%) all-cause mortality over a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 241 (106-350) days. In our cox hazard proportional analysis, absence of oxygen requirement during COVID-19 compared to oxygen need [HR = 0.14(0.03-0.59); p-value = 0.0071], and use of thymoglobulin use compared to other induction strategies [HR = 0.17(0.03-0.95); p-value = 0.044] had a lower risk for AR. Degree of Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR mismatch had the highest risk of AR [HR = 10.2(1.74-65.83); p-value = 0.011]. With competing risk analysis, with death as a competing event, HLA DR mismatch, and oxygen requirement continued to be associated with AR. Age, gender, obesity, inflammatory markers, dialysis vintage, steroid use, sensitization and ABO-incompatibility have not been associated with a higher risk of AR. The median duration between COVID-19 real time polymerase test negativity to transplant was 88(40-145) days (overall), and ranged from 88(40-137), 65(42-120), 110(49-190), and 127(64-161) days in World Health Organization ordinal scale </= 3, 4, 5, and 6-7, respectively. There was no difference in quality of life, tacrolimus levels, blood counts, and mean serum creatinine assessed in patients with a past COVID-19 infection independent of severity. Interpretation: Our findings support that the outcomes of KT after COVID-19 recovery are excellent with absence of COVID-19 sequelae during follow-up.

18,35338811,"INTRODUCTION: The current evidence indicates that the severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is lower in the pediatric population but local data are still limited. Objective: To characterize the clinical and epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 infection in patients younger than 18 years in Argentina. POPULATION AND METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational, and analytical study of confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 0-18 years seen between March 2020 and March 2021 at 19 referral children's hospitals of Argentina. A multivariate analysis was done to identify predictors of severe cases. RESULTS: A total of 2690 COVID-19 cases were included: 77.7% lived in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires; 50.1% were males; patients' median age was 5.6 years. Of them, 90% were seen during epidemiological weeks 20-47 of 2020; 60.4% had a history of contact with COVID-19 patients; and 96.6% in their family setting. Also, 51.4% had respiratory symptoms; 61.6%, general symptoms; 18.8%, gastrointestinal symptoms; 17.1%, neurological symptoms; 7.2%, other symptoms; and 21.5% were asymptomatic. In addition, 59.4% of patients were hospitalized and 7.4% had a severe or critical course. A total of 57 patients developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome. A history of asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease, moderate to severe malnutrition, obesity, chronic neurological disease and/or age younger than 6 months were independent predictors of severity. Living in a vulnerable neighborhood was a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of cases referred a history of contact with COVID-19 patients in the family setting.

19,35338798,"As a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, there has been a surge in the prevalence and severity of non-syndromic pediatric overweight (NSPO) in the United States. Prevention interventions such as engagement in regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity have been consistently shown to mitigate the development and maintenance of NSPO. Yet, African-American adolescent females, a subgroup of the population disparately impacted by NSPO, are less likely to engage in regular physical activity. Although multidimensional global self-concept has been identified as a possible predictor of physical activity engagement, dimensional linkage with physical activity engagement among members of this subgroup has yet to be established. This secondary analysis of data from N = 312 urban dwelling African-American adolescent females sought to evaluate the contribution that selected dimensions of global self-concept had on engagement in vigorous physical activity. Findings from a 3-Model hierarchical regression analysis found that in addition to socioeconomic position, several social desirability and competence dimensions of global self-concept were significant predictive contributors to physical activity engagement among members of the study cohort. Specifically, these were the dimensions of physical appearance, romantic appeal, close friendship, social acceptance, and scholastic competence. Although more research is needed, results from this study have important implications for population health.","As a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, there has been a surge in the prevalence and severity of non-syndromic pediatric overweight (NSPO) in the United States.

20,35322953,"Background: Background. SARS-CoV-2 virus is one of the largest RNA viruses, included in the coronavirus group, showing tropism to airway epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 causes an acute respiratory infectious disease, Covid-19. According to WHO reports, mortality due to Covid-19 is higher in the elderly and in those burdened with comorbidities such as diabetes, obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, cancer, hypertension, hepatitis B, obesity or chronic kidney disease. Objective: The aim of the study was to review the current literature on the influence and importance of vitamin D levels on the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Material and method: A systematic review of studies published from January 1, 2009 to June 31, 2021 has been performed. For this purpose, bibliographic databases such as PubMed and Scopus were searched. The following keywords and combinations were used: Covid-19, vitamin D, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, vitamin D supplementation, SARS-CoV-2. Results: It has been shown that vitamin D plays an important role in the mechanisms of the innate immunity in the course of the acute respiratory infections. The overlapping factors of the severity of COVID-19 disease, vitamin D deficiency, and the prevalence of obesity, age scare, ethnicity, has led some researchers to hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation may be promising as a preventive or therapeutic measure for COVID-19.

21,35316959,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal liver chemistries are common findings in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the association of these abnormalities with the severity of COVID-19 and clinical outcomes is poorly understood. AIM: We aimed to assess the prevalence of elevated liver chemistries in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and compare the serum liver chemistries to predict the severity and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study included 3380 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in the Johns Hopkins Health System (Baltimore, MD, United States). Demographic data, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment measures, and outcome data were collected. Cox regression modeling was used to explore variables associated with abnormal liver chemistries on admission with disease severity and prognosis. RESULTS: A total of 2698 (70.4%) had abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at the time of admission. Other more prevalent abnormal liver chemistries were aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (44.4%), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (16.1%), and total bilirubin (T-Bil) (5.9%). Factors associated with liver injury were older age, Asian ethnicity, other race, being overweight, and obesity. Higher ALT, AST, T-Bil, and ALP levels were more commonly associated with disease severity. Multivariable adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that abnormal AST and T-Bil were associated with the highest mortality risk than other liver injury indicators during hospitalization. Abnormal AST, T-Bil, and ALP were associated with a need for vasopressor drugs, whereas higher levels of AST, T-Bil, and a decreased albumin levels were associated with mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Abnormal liver chemistries are common at the time of hospital admission in COVID-19 patients and can be closely related to the patient's severity and prognosis. Elevated liver chemistries, specifically ALT, AST, ALP, and T-Bil levels, can be used to stratify risk and predict the need for advanced therapies in these patients.","BACKGROUND: Abnormal liver chemistries are common findings in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

22,35308711,"Background and objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in China two years ago as primarily a lung infection associated with cough and fever. It spread rapidly across the world and was declared a pandemic in early 2020, with 131 million people infected and 2.85 million deaths worldwide. To date, approximately 550,000 deaths have occurred due to COVID-19 in the United States and the numbers continue to rise. The extrapulmonary manifestations of this disease such as acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiovascular events, and gastrointestinal (GI) indications were not emphasized initially. However, subsequent studies from the United States and Canada have noted GI involvement in this disease in a large number of cases. Our group, taking care of these patients during the early phase of the pandemic in 2020, observed the frequent presentations of GI symptoms such as diarrhea and hepatic dysfunction and this study examines the same. Methods We undertook a retrospective study of 184 consecutive adult patients who were hospitalized at our center with confirmed COVID-19 infection, with a view to further elucidate the GI and hepatic involvement during the early breakout (March 17-May 17, 2020) of this illness. Results Major comorbidities associated with this illness in our cohort of patients included hypertension (HTN, 66%), diabetes mellitus (DM, 44%), obesity (41%), and chronic kidney disease (CKD, 17%). The most common GI manifestation was diarrhea (25%) and, interestingly, more than two-thirds of the patients had at least one liver function abnormality. The most common liver function abnormality was elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Elevated AST was significantly correlated (p<0.05) with inflammatory markers such as D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ferritin, as well as AKI by bi-variate analysis. Salient observations from our study include higher mortality, frequent AKI, and cardiovascular events in male patients (p<0.05). The liver injury in our cohort was suspected to be multifactorial, involving excessive cytokine release, viral infiltration of the hepatocytes, and cholangiocytes playing a role in transaminitis. The mean (+/-SD) duration of hospital stay was 13.5 +/-15 days with 33% admissions to the ICU. The overall mortality was around 27%, with no significant difference between African Americans and Caucasians. However, patients admitted to the ICU had a very high mortality rate (54%) compared to those admitted to intermediate care (IMC)/acute care who had less severity of illness and associated pulmonary complications. Conclusions This study evaluates the presence of comorbidities such as DM, HTN, and obesity in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at a community hospital in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Statistical analysis of the data obtained for this cohort revealed a high frequency of GI symptoms, with diarrhea as the predominant common initial manifestation of the disease. Serum AST elevations were common and correlated with inflammatory markers and AKI. Male gender was also significantly associated with the development of AKI, higher frequency of cardiovascular events, and increased mortality. Overall mortality was noted to be 27%, with higher mortality in patients admitted to the ICU (54%) as compared to the IMC/floor (13%). These observations should spur future investigations into the role of these comorbidities, development of diarrhea, and hepatic dysfunction in COVID-19.","Background and objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in China two years ago as primarily a lung infection associated with cough and fever.

23,35308674,"Background In this study, we aimed to compare two outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Belgium in tomographic and biological-clinical aspects with artificial intelligence (AI). Methodology We performed an observational retrospective study. Adult patients who were symptomatic in the first seven days with COVID-19 infection, diagnosed by chest computed tomography (CT) and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, were included in this study. The first wave of the pandemic lasted from March 25, 2020, to May 25, 2020, and the second wave lasted from October 7, 2020, to December 7, 2020. For each wave, two subgroups were defined depending on whether respiratory failure occurred during the course of the disease. The quantitative estimation of COVID-19 lung lesions was performed by AI, radiologists, and radiology residents. The chest CT severity score was calculated by AI. Results In the 202 patients included in this study, we found statistically significant differences for obesity, hypertension, and asthma. The differences were predominant in the second wave. Moreover, a mixed distribution (central and peripherical) of pulmonary lesions was noted in the second wave, but no differences were noted regarding mortality, respiratory failure, complications, and other radiological and biological elements. Chest CT severity score was among the risk factors of mortality and respiratory failure. There was a mild agreement between AI and visual evaluation of pulmonary lesion extension (K = 0.4). Conclusions Between March and December 2020, in our cohort, for the majority of the parameters analyzed, we did not record significant changes between the two waves. AI can reduce the experience and performance gap of radiologists and better establish a hospitalization criterion.","Background In this study, we aimed to compare two outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Belgium in tomographic and biological-clinical aspects with artificial intelligence (AI).

25,35270015,"Almost two years have passed since the outbreak reported for the first time in Wuhan of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 coronavirus, rapidly evolved into a pandemic. This infectious disease has stressed global health care systems. The mortality rate is higher, particularly in elderly population and in patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, chronic renal disease, and malignancy. Among them, subjects with diabetes have a high risk of developing severe form of COVID-19 and show increased mortality. How diabetes contributes to COVID-19 severity remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that it may be correlated with the effects of hyperglycemia on systemic inflammatory responses and immune system dysfunction. Vitamin D (VD) is a modulator of immune-response. Data from literature showed that vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 patients increases COVID-19 severity, likely because of its negative impact on immune and inflammatory responses. Therefore, the use of vitamin D might play a role in some aspects of the infection, particularly the inflammatory state and the immune system function of patients. Moreover, a piece of evidence highlighted a link among vitamin D deficiency, obesity and diabetes, all factors associated with COVID-19 severity. Given this background, we performed an overview of the systematic reviews to assess the association between vitamin D supplementation and inflammatory markers in patients with diabetes; furthermore, vitamin D's possible role in COVID-19 patients was assessed as well. Three databases, namely MEDLINE, PubMed Central and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, were reviewed to retrieve the pertinent data. The aim of this review is to provide insight into the recent advances about the molecular basis of the relationship between vitamin D, immune response, inflammation, diabetes and COVID-19.","Almost two years have passed since the outbreak reported for the first time in Wuhan of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 coronavirus, rapidly evolved into a pandemic. This infectious disease has stressed global health care systems. The mortality rate is higher, particularly in elderly population and in patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, chronic renal disease, and malignancy. Among them, subjects with diabetes have a high risk of developing severe form of COVID-19 and show increased mortality. How diabetes contributes to COVID-19 severity remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that it may be correlated with the effects of hyperglycemia on systemic inflammatory responses and immune system dysfunction.

27,35268503,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of regdanvimab on clinical outcomes in patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This retrospective observational study included 152 patients (89 received regdanvimab and 63 did not) diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 between August 2021 and October 2021 and admitted to Armed Forces Goyang Hospital. We collected information on the use of regdanvimab, remdesivir, dexamethasone, and supplemental oxygen; symptom severity score (SSS); and laboratory test results. A linear mixed-effects model was used to test the effectiveness of regdanvimab usage on SSS and the results of laboratory tests. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for additional therapeutic options, such as remdesivir, dexamethasone, and supplemental oxygen. RESULTS: The patients who received regdanvimab were older, showed a higher rate of vaccination, and had a higher Charlson comorbidity index, initial body temperature, and percentages of pneumonia at admission. The use of regdanvimab showed no interactive effects on the SSS and laboratory findings. Older age, male sex, obesity, high initial body temperature, and the presence of pneumonia at admission were associated with increased ORs for the use of these additional treatments. The use of regdanvimab reduced the probability of requiring additional therapies such as remdesivir, dexamethasone, and oxygen supplementation by 90.3% (95% confidence interval (CI), 60.3-97.6), 85.8% (95% CI, 34.2-96.9), and 89.8% (95% CI, 48.3-98), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Regdanvimab usage was well tolerated and was associated with a decreased probability of requiring remdesivir, dexamethasone, and oxygen therapy.

28,35251803,"Since its initial reporting in December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global health problem after its official declaration as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, with an estimated 346 million cases and over 5.9 million fatalities as of January 22, 2022. Studies on the prevalence of COVID-19 among severe cases have shown that comorbidities and risk factors such as obesity, increased aging, and chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases play a role in the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The interactions between such factors and their involvement with the progression of infection and mortality remain unclear. While it is known that SARS-CoV-2 damages the lungs, various morbidities such as acute kidney disease and thyroid dysregulation have recently emerged in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Conditions that alter thyroid hormones, which play a critical role in regulating metabolic pathways, have a role in the level of infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2. The capability of the SARS-CoV-2 to invade and affect any organ system is dependent on its access to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) commonly expressed among various host cells. This binding puts any system at high risk of direct viral injury, inevitably creating an excessively high concentration of anti-inflammatory mediators and cytokines to predispose COVID-19 patients to a state of severe immunosuppression. This case report describes a 62-year-old female who tested positive for COVID-19, with a medical history of hypothyroidism, who presented with a unique combination of acute bacterial hemorrhagic pyelonephritis and ureteral obstruction. She experienced intermittent dysuria, urinary urgency, and hematuria over the past five days. She developed chills, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting after administering acetaminophen for her headache. Ageusia and anosmia accompanied her respiratory illnesses despite receiving the Pfizer double dose vaccine six months before her arrival. A computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed severe to moderate inflammation surrounding the enlarged kidney with a 1 mm ureteral stone. Blood and urine cultures showed the growth of Escherichia coli gram-negative bacilli. Chest X-rays displayed a patchy appearance in the right infrahilar airspace, reflecting atelectasis in part for the diagnosis of COVID-19 with additional laboratory findings of profoundly elevated C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and d-dimer levels. Abdominal CT scans revealed a hemorrhagic ureteral obstruction and massive swelling of the renal parenchyma persistent to pyelonephritis and hydronephrosis.","Since its initial reporting in December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a global health problem after its official declaration as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, with an estimated 346 million cases and over 5.9 million fatalities as of January 22, 2022.

The genetic background represents a factor that predisposes the way the host responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this sense, genetic variants of ACE and ACE2 could explain the observed interindividual variability to COVID-19 outcomes. In order to improve the understanding of how genetic variants of ACE and ACE2 are involved in the severity of COVID-19, we included a total of 481 individuals who showed clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and were diagnosed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR).

ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism was evaluated by the high-resolution melting method; ACE single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs4344) and ACE2 SNPs (rs2285666 and rs2074192) were genotyped using TaqMan probes. We assessed the association of ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms with disease severity using logistic regression analysis adjusted by age, sex, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. The severity of the illness in our study population was divided as 31% mild, 26% severe, and 43% critical illness; additionally, 18% of individuals died, of whom 54% were male. Our results showed in the codominant model a contribution of ACE2 gene rs2285666 T/T genotype to critical outcome [odds ratio (OR) = 1.83; 95%CI = 1.01-3.29; p = 0.04] and to require oxygen supplementation (OR = 1.76; 95%CI = 1.01-3.04; p = 0.04), in addition to a strong association of the T allele of this variant to develop critical illness in male individuals (OR = 1.81; 95%CI = 1.10-2.98; p = 0.02).

32,35226338,"PURPOSE: to outline the clinical and laboratorial profile of patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery who presented positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (Sars-CoV-2) in the preoperative period without symptoms presentation. METHODS: Case series of 17 patients undergoing bariatric surgery who presented positive RT-PCR for Sars-CoV-2 in the preoperative period, with no reported symptoms. Data collected included demographic characteristics, length of hospital stay, waiting time for surgery, inflammatory markers, serum levels of micronutrients and dengue virus (DENV) serology. RESULTS: In total, 219 patients underwent bariatric surgery in our institution during the study period. The incidence of asymptomatic cases was 7.7%. The sample comprised 88.2% of women, with mean age of 39.3 years and mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) of 37.7 kg/m2. Thirty five percent of the sample had previous diagnosis of diabetes and 29.4% had hypertension. The mean time elapsed between positive RT-PCR and the operation was 17 +/- 7.5 days and the mean length of postoperative hospital stay was 1.9 +/- 0.43 day. Mean lymphocytes count was 2,409.7/mm3 and the mean platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was 126.3. Mean C-reactive protein value was 5.8 mg/dL, while ferritin marked 107.4 microg/L. DENV IgG was identified in all patients who tested for it. Mean levels of vitamin D and zinc were 25.6 ng/mL and 79.9 microg/dL, respectively. There were no postoperative complications reported. CONCLUSION: None of the included patients presented any of the laboratory markers related to disease severity. Moreover, it is important to notice that all patients who tested for DENV, had the specific IgG detected in their serum.","PURPOSE: to outline the clinical and laboratorial profile of patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery who presented positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (Sars-CoV-2) in the preoperative period without symptoms presentation.

33,35219376,"BACKGROUND: The infection-fatality ratio (IFR) is a metric that quantifies the likelihood of an individual dying once infected with a pathogen. Understanding the determinants of IFR variation for COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has direct implications for mitigation efforts with respect to clinical practice, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and the prioritisation of risk groups for targeted vaccine delivery. The IFR is also a crucial parameter in COVID-19 dynamic transmission models, providing a way to convert a population's mortality rate into an estimate of infections. METHODS: We estimated age-specific and all-age IFR by matching seroprevalence surveys to total COVID-19 mortality rates in a population. The term total COVID-19 mortality refers to an estimate of the total number of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19. After applying exclusion criteria to 5131 seroprevalence surveys, the IFR analyses were informed by 2073 all-age surveys and 718 age-specific surveys (3012 age-specific observations). When seroprevalence was reported by age group, we split total COVID-19 mortality into corresponding age groups using a Bayesian hierarchical model to characterise the non-linear age pattern of reported deaths for a given location. To remove the impact of vaccines on the estimated IFR age pattern, we excluded age-specific observations of seroprevalence and deaths that occurred after vaccines were introduced in a location. We estimated age-specific IFR with a non-linear meta-regression and used the resulting age pattern to standardise all-age IFR observations to the global age distribution. All IFR observations were adjusted for baseline and waning antibody-test sensitivity. We then modelled age-standardised IFR as a function of time, geography, and an ensemble of 100 of the top-performing covariate sets. The covariates included seven clinical predictors (eg, age-standardised obesity prevalence) and two measures of health system performance. Final estimates for 190 countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in 11 countries and territories, were obtained by predicting age-standardised IFR conditional on covariates and reversing the age standardisation. FINDINGS: We report IFR estimates for April 15, 2020, to January 1, 2021, the period before the introduction of vaccines and widespread evolution of variants. We found substantial heterogeneity in the IFR by age, location, and time. Age-specific IFR estimates form a J shape, with the lowest IFR occurring at age 7 years (0.0023%, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0.0015-0.0039) and increasing exponentially through ages 30 years (0.0573%, 0.0418-0.0870), 60 years (1.0035%, 0.7002-1.5727), and 90 years (20.3292%, 14.6888-28.9754). The countries with the highest IFR on July 15, 2020, were Portugal (2.085%, 0.946-4.395), Monaco (1.778%, 1.265-2.915), Japan (1.750%, 1.302-2.690), Spain (1.710%, 0.991-2.718), and Greece (1.637%, 1.155-2.678). All-age IFR varied by a factor of more than 30 among 190 countries and territories. After age standardisation, the countries with the highest IFR on July 15, 2020, were Peru (0.911%, 0.636-1.538), Portugal (0.850%, 0.386-1.793), Oman (0.762%, 0.381-1.399), Spain (0.751%, 0.435-1.193), and Mexico (0.717%, 0.426-1.404). Subnational locations with high IFRs also included hotspots in the UK and southern and eastern states of the USA. Sub-Saharan African countries and Asian countries generally had the lowest all-age and age-standardised IFRs. Population age structure accounted for 74% of logit-scale variation in IFRs estimated for 39 in-sample countries on July 15, 2020. A post-hoc analysis showed that high rates of transmission in the care home population might account for higher IFRs in some locations. Among all countries and territories, we found that the median IFR decreased from 0.466% (interquartile range 0.223-0.840) to 0.314% (0.143-0.551) between April 15, 2020, and Jan 1, 2021. INTERPRETATION: Estimating the IFR for global populations helps to identify relative vulnerabilities to COVID-19. Information about how IFR varies by age, time, and location informs clinical practice and non-pharmaceutical interventions like physical distancing measures, and underpins vaccine risk stratification. IFR and mortality risk form a J shape with respect to age, which previous research, such as that by Glynn and Moss in 2020, has identified to be a common pattern among infectious diseases. Understanding the experience of a population with COVID-19 mortality requires consideration for local factors; IFRs varied by a factor of more than 30 among 190 countries and territories in this analysis. In particular, the presence of elevated age-standardised IFRs in countries with well resourced health-care systems indicates that factors beyond health-care capacity are important. Potential extenuating circumstances include outbreaks among care home residents, variable burdens of severe cases, and the population prevalence of comorbid conditions that increase the severity of COVID-19 disease. During the pre-vaccine period, the estimated 33% decrease in median IFR over 8 months suggests that treatment for COVID-19 has improved over time. Estimating IFR for the pre-vaccine era provides an important baseline for describing the progression of COVID-19 mortality patterns.

35,35198310,"INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, the emergence of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan, China. Thereafter, the disease has been spreading rapidly across the world, with about 300 million registered cases worldwide, and the numbers are also exponentially increasing in India, with about 34 million registered cases by the end of 2021. Among the comorbidities, obesity may increase the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection as it is related to immune system dysfunction. Since the epidemiological picture of COVID-19 is changing very rapidly. Therefore, it is very important to discuss the pattern of clinical manifestation and association with comorbidities. Hence, we have conducted this observational study in one of the tertiary care centers in North India. Methods and Materials: We conducted a hospital-based prospective observational study in dedicated COVID-19 wards and ICU of a tertiary care center in North India with a sample size of 400 positive patients (males: 260, females: 140). We divided the patients in this study into three different age groups (less than 40 years, 40-60 years, and more than 60 years). The patients with age </= 18 years and BMI 18.5 kg/m2 were excluded from the study. Results: Out of these 400 patients, 55 (13.8%) developed severe COVID-19. There was a fewer number of patients who developed severe COVID-19 in the normal and over-weight group. Moreover, obese patients progressed to more severe cases (34.5%). This also shows that after adjusting for age, compared to the normal-weight group, those who were overweight had a 1.48-fold chance of developing severe COVID-19 (OR 1.48, P 0.0455), while those who were obese had a 1.73-fold chance of developing the disease (ORs 1.73, P 5 0.0652). Regarding gender distribution, the association appeared to be stronger in men than in women. After similar adjustment, the ORs for overweight and obese patients compared to normal-weight patients were 1.39 (p 0.5870) and 3.55 (p 0.0113) in females and 1.36 (0.5115) and 6.19 (0.0001) in males, respectively. Conclusion: Our study shows that obese patients with a BMI of greater than or equal to 27.5 are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 severity, especially in the male population. Moreover, severity may be related to other comorbid conditions. However, in our study, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and GI/liver diseases were less obese, and severity was relatively low. So, the conclusion is that obese male patients with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 infection.","INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, the emergence of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan, China.

After similar adjustment, the ORs for overweight and obese patients compared to normal-weight patients were 1.39 (p 0.5870) and 3.55 (p 0.0113) in females and 1.36 (0.5115) and 6.19 (0.0001) in males, respectively. Conclusion: Our study shows that obese patients with a BMI of greater than or equal to 27.5 are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 severity, especially in the male population. Moreover, severity may be related to other comorbid conditions. However, in our study, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and GI/liver diseases were less obese, and severity was relatively low. So, the conclusion is that obese male patients with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 infection.",Mir IA, O,Journal Article," INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, the emergence<br>of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<br>began in Wuhan, China.

36,35189888,"BACKGROUND: Prospective population-based studies investigating multiple determinants of pre-vaccination antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are lacking. METHODS: We did a prospective population-based study in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-naive UK adults recruited between May 1 and November 2, 2020, without a positive swab test result for SARS-CoV-2 prior to enrolment. Information on 88 potential sociodemographic, behavioural, nutritional, clinical and pharmacological risk factors was obtained through online questionnaires, and combined IgG/IgA/IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein were determined in dried blood spots obtained between November 6, 2020, and April 18, 2021. We used logistic and linear regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and adjusted geometric mean ratios (aGMRs) for potential determinants of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity (all participants) and antibody titres (seropositive participants only), respectively. RESULTS: Of 11,130 participants, 1696 (15.2%) were seropositive. Factors independently associated with higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity included frontline health/care occupation (aOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.48-2.33), international travel (1.20, 1.07-1.35), number of visits to shops and other indoor public places (>/= 5 vs. 0/week: 1.29, 1.06-1.57, P-trend = 0.01), body mass index (BMI) >/= 25 vs. < 25 kg/m(2) (1.24, 1.11-1.39), South Asian vs. White ethnicity (1.65, 1.10-2.49) and alcohol consumption >/=15 vs. 0 units/week (1.23, 1.04-1.46). Light physical exercise associated with lower risk (0.80, 0.70-0.93, for >/= 10 vs. 0-4 h/week). Among seropositive participants, higher titres of anti-Spike antibodies associated with factors including BMI >/= 30 vs. < 25 kg/m(2) (aGMR 1.10, 1.02-1.19), South Asian vs. White ethnicity (1.22, 1.04-1.44), frontline health/care occupation (1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.39), international travel (1.11, 1.05-1.16) and number of visits to shops and other indoor public places (>/= 5 vs. 0/week: 1.12, 1.02-1.23, P-trend = 0.01); these associations were not substantially attenuated by adjustment for COVID-19 disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Higher alcohol consumption and lower light physical exercise represent new modifiable risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recognised associations between South Asian ethnic origin and obesity and higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were independent of other sociodemographic, behavioural, nutritional, clinical, and pharmacological factors investigated. Among seropositive participants, higher titres of anti-Spike antibodies in people of South Asian ancestry and in obese people were not explained by greater COVID-19 disease severity in these groups.","BACKGROUND: Prospective population-based studies investigating multiple determinants of pre-vaccination antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are lacking.

37,35180316,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Primary hypothyroidism is a common comorbid condition, but little is known about its association with COVID-19 severity and outcomes. This study aims to identify the frequency of hypothyroidism in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 as well as describe the differences in outcomes between patients with and without pre-existing hypothyroidism using an observational, multinational registry. METHODS: In an observational cohort study we enrolled patients 18 years or older, with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection between March 2020 and February 2021. The primary outcomes were (1) the disease severity defined as per the World Health Organization Scale for Clinical Improvement, which is an ordinal outcome corresponding with the highest severity level recorded during a patient's index COVID-19 hospitalization, (2) in-hospital mortality and (3) hospital-free days. Secondary outcomes were the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and ICU mortality. RESULTS: Among the 20,366 adult patients included in the study, pre-existing hypothyroidism was identified in 1616 (7.9%). The median age for the Hypothyroidism group was 70 (interquartile range: 59-80) years, and 65% were female and 67% were White. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (68%), diabetes (42%), dyslipidemia (37%) and obesity (28%). After adjusting for age, body mass index, sex, admission date in the quarter year since March 2020, race, smoking history and other comorbid conditions (coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia), pre-existing hypothyroidism was not associated with higher odds of severe disease using the World Health Organization disease severity index (odds ratio [OR]: 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92, 1.13; p = .69), in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.15; p = .58) or differences in hospital-free days (estimated difference 0.01 days; 95% CI: -0.45, 0.47; p = .97). Pre-existing hypothyroidism was not associated with ICU admission or ICU mortality in unadjusted as well as in adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In an international registry, hypothyroidism was identified in around 1 of every 12 adult hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Pre-existing hypothyroidism in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was not associated with higher disease severity or increased risk of mortality or ICU admissions. However, more research on the possible effects of COVID-19 on the thyroid gland and its function is needed in the future.","INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality.

38,35168081,"BACKGROUND: Various immunomodulatory therapies have been explored to manage the dysregulated immune response seen in severe COVID-19 infection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in severe and critical COVID-19 disease. METHODS: This retrospective study included 535 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital, from May 2020 to December 2020. Primary outcome was the percentage of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were a) in-hospital mortality, b) 28-day mortality, c) ICU-length of stay (ICU-LOS), d) days to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, and e) days to COVID-PCR negativity. Logistic regression and linear regression were performed using the adjusted and unadjusted analyses. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 535 patients out of which 255 (47.7%) received IVIG along with standard treatment and 280 (52.3%) received only standard treatment. Two groups were similar in terms of COVID-19 severity, APACHE II score, oxygen requirements, and initial management. The requirement of invasive ventilation was significantly less in the IVIG group compared to the Non-IVIG group (32.2% vs 40.4%, p < 0.05). In-hospital mortality, 28-day mortality, and ICU-LOS were also significantly less in the IVIG group (all p < 0.05). Subgroup analysis within the IVIG group showed that early administration of IVIG (</=7 days from ICU admission), old age (>/=65 years), and obesity were associated with better outcomes (need for mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality) (all p < 0.05). IVIG administration in patients with chronic respiratory disease was associated with a reduced requirement for mechanical ventilation (p < 0.05), but there was an insignificant improvement in mortality. CONCLUSION: High-dose IVIG improves outcomes in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. The study also underscores the importance of timing and patient selection when administering IVIG.","BACKGROUND: Various immunomodulatory therapies have been explored to manage the dysregulated immune response seen in severe COVID-19 infection.

39,35151400,"Metabolomics (both targeted and untargeted) has become the gold standard in biomarker discovery. Whereas targeted approaches only provide information for the selected markers, thus hampering the determination of out-of-the-box markers, the common bottleneck of untargeted metabolomics is the identification of detected biomarkers. In this study, we developed a strategy based on derivatization and LC-MS/MS detection in a precursor ion scan for the untargeted determination of a specific part of the metabolome (carbonyl-containing metabolites). The usefulness of this guided metabolomics approach has been demonstrated by elucidating carbonyl-containing biomarkers of COVID-19 severity. First, the LC-MS/MS behavior of 63 model compounds after O-benzylhydroxylamine derivatization was studied. A precursor ion scan of m/z 91 was selected as a suitable approach for the untargeted detection of carbonyl-containing metabolites. The method was able to detect approximately 300 potential carbonyl-containing molecules in plasma, including mono-/di-/tricarbonylic compounds with satisfactory intra-day and inter-day repeatability and RSDs commonly <15%. Additionally, the semiquantitative nature of the precursor ion scan method was confirmed by comparison with a fully validated targeted method. The application of the guided metabolomics method to COVID-19 plasma samples revealed the presence of four potential COVID-19 severity biomarkers. Based on their LC-MS/MS behavior, these biomarkers were elucidated as 2-hydroxybutyrate, 2,3-dihydroxybutyrate, 2-oxobutyrate and 2-hydroxy-3-methylbutyrate. Their structures were confirmed by comparison with reference materials. The alterations of these biomarkers with COVID-19 severity were confirmed by a target analysis of a larger set of samples.

COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia have a higher risk for critical illness, mostly complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. The inflammatory response is critical, and the cytokine storm increases the severity of COVID-19. Many factors could be associated with a cytokine storm but they are incompletely understood. This study presents characteristics of COVID-19 patients and explore the clinical and inflammatory parameters of severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted in all severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Peripheral blood was taken for laboratory examination within 24 hours of admission. Haematologic parameters, serum electrolyte, renal function, liver function, pancreas enzyme, D-dimer, inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed in this study. Comparative analyses were done between sex, existing comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), and COVID-19 vaccination status. Results: A total of 80 subjects were included in the study. The most frequent comorbidities found among the subjects were obesity (36.35%) and diabetes (22.5%). Only 13.75% of subjects were vaccinated. Laboratory results indicated leucocytosis and neutrophilia, with a neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR) of 7. The mean inflammatory findings (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, MCP-1), D-dimer, CRP, and lipase increased. Lipase levels were higher in men (p = 0.003) and in comorbidity groups. No significant differences were found among different BMI groups. Lipase, IL-6, and MCP-1 levels were significantly higher (p=0.019, <0.0001, and 0.03, respectively) in the non-vaccinated group.

The most frequent comorbidities found among the subjects were obesity (36.35%) and diabetes (22.5%). Only 13.75% of subjects were vaccinated. Laboratory results indicated leucocytosis and neutrophilia, with a neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR) of 7. The mean inflammatory findings (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, MCP-1), D-dimer, CRP, and lipase increased. Lipase levels were higher in men (p = 0.003) and in comorbidity groups. No significant differences were found among different BMI groups. Lipase, IL-6, and MCP-1 levels were significantly higher (p=0.019, <0.0001, and 0.03, respectively) in the non-vaccinated group.

This study aimed to determine whether individuals with obesity compared to individuals with normal weight have an increased risk for severe COVID-19. We conducted a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library and critically reviewed the secondary literature using AMSTAR-2. We explored 27 studies. Findings indicate that individuals with obesity (body mass index >/= 30 kg/m(2) ), as compared to individuals without obesity, experience an increased risk for hospitalization (odds ratio [OR]: 1.40-2.45), admission to the intensive care unit (OR: 1.30-2.32), invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.47-2.63), and the composite outcome 'severe outcome' (OR or risk ratio: 1.62-4.31). We found diverging results concerning death to COVID-19, but data trended towards increased mortality. Comparing individuals with obesity to individuals without obesity, findings suggested younger individuals (<60 years) experience a higher risk of severe disease compared to older individuals (>/=60 years). Obesity augments the severity of COVID-19 including a tendency to increased mortality and, thus, contributes to an increased disease burden, especially among younger individuals.","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic calls for identification of risk factors, which may help to identify people at enhanced risk for severe disease outcomes to improve treatment and, if possible, establish prophylactic measures.

42,35137371,"INTRODUCTION: The recent global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has involved more than 7 million people worldwide and been associated with more than 400,000 deaths. No clear information is known about all the potential risk factors for COVID-19 or what factors adversely influence its clinical course and mortality. Therefore, we analyzed the role of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension as risk factors for COVID-19. METHODS: We identified articles for inclusion by searching PubMed and Google Scholar (last accessed 15 June 2020). Retrospective review of literature. Analysis of epidemiological data concerning obesity prevalence and COVID-19 incidence, particularly in Italy and the USA. RESULTS: Data from several retrospective studies of prevalence showed that patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and obesity may have more severe COVID-19, intensive care unit admission, and higher mortality rates, but it is not definitively clear if this is an independent association. In general, the prevalence of obesity in patients with COVID-19 seems to be the same as that of the general population throughout the world; however, obesity seems to be associated with more severe disease and mortality in younger (< 60 years) patients. Similar effects seem to occur in patients with diabetes and/or hypertension but at older ages (> 60 years). In strict connection, it has been proposed that the use of drugs inhibiting angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) or dipeptidyl dipeptidase 4 (DPP-4) might influence viral activity and disease severity since ACE-2 and DPP-4 receptors mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells; however, no evidence exists to date that shows that this may be the case. CONCLUSION: Overall, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity seem to negatively affect the clinical course and disease outcome in patients with COVID-19. However, these data need further confirmation by studies with more accurate data registration.","INTRODUCTION: The recent global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has involved more than 7 million people worldwide and been associated with more than 400,000 deaths.

43,35135773,"BACKGROUND: The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7 lineage) of SARS-CoV-2 emerged and became the dominant circulating variant in the UK in late 2020. Current literature is unclear on whether the Alpha variant is associated with increased severity. We linked clinical data with viral genome sequence data to compare admitted cases between SARS-CoV-2 waves in London and to investigate the association between the Alpha variant and the severity of disease. METHODS: Clinical, demographic, laboratory and viral sequence data from electronic health record systems were collected for all cases with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test between 13 March 2020 and 17 February 2021 in a multisite London healthcare institution. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression assessed risk factors for severity as defined by hypoxia at admission. RESULTS: There were 5810 SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive cases of which 2341 were admitted (838 in wave 1 and 1503 in wave 2). Both waves had a temporally aligned rise in nosocomial cases (96 in wave 1 and 137 in wave 2). The Alpha variant was first identified on 15 November 2020 and increased rapidly to comprise 400/472 (85%) of sequenced isolates from admitted cases in wave 2. A multivariate analysis identified risk factors for severity on admission, such as age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03, for every year older; p<0.001), obesity (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.26; p<0.001) and infection with the Alpha variant (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.24; p<0.001).

44,35133437,"Importance: Understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in US children has been limited by the lack of large, multicenter studies with granular data. Objective: To examine the characteristics, changes over time, outcomes, and severity risk factors of children with SARS-CoV-2 within the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort study of encounters with end dates before September 24, 2021, was conducted at 56 N3C facilities throughout the US. Participants included children younger than 19 years at initial SARS-CoV-2 testing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Case incidence and severity over time, demographic and comorbidity severity risk factors, vital sign and laboratory trajectories, clinical outcomes, and acute COVID-19 vs multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and Delta vs pre-Delta variant differences for children with SARS-CoV-2. Results: A total of 1068410 children were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 167262 test results (15.6%) were positive (82882 [49.6%] girls; median age, 11.9 [IQR, 6.0-16.1] years). Among the 10245 children (6.1%) who were hospitalized, 1423 (13.9%) met the criteria for severe disease: mechanical ventilation (796 [7.8%]), vasopressor-inotropic support (868 [8.5%]), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (42 [0.4%]), or death (131 [1.3%]). Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.21-1.56), Black/African American race (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.06-1.47), obesity (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01-1.41), and several pediatric complex chronic condition (PCCC) subcategories were associated with higher severity disease. Vital signs and many laboratory test values from the day of admission were predictive of peak disease severity. Variables associated with increased odds for MIS-C vs acute COVID-19 included male sex (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.33-1.90), Black/African American race (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.17-1.77), younger than 12 years (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.51-2.18), obesity (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.40-2.22), and not having a pediatric complex chronic condition (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.80). The children with MIS-C had a more inflammatory laboratory profile and severe clinical phenotype, with higher rates of invasive ventilation (117 of 707 [16.5%] vs 514 of 8241 [6.2%]; P < .001) and need for vasoactive-inotropic support (191 of 707 [27.0%] vs 426 of 8241 [5.2%]; P < .001) compared with those who had acute COVID-19. Comparing children during the Delta vs pre-Delta eras, there was no significant change in hospitalization rate (1738 [6.0%] vs 8507 [6.2%]; P = .18) and lower odds for severe disease (179 [10.3%] vs 1242 [14.6%]) (decreased by a factor of 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.79; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of US children with SARS-CoV-2, there were observed differences in demographic characteristics, preexisting comorbidities, and initial vital sign and laboratory values between severity subgroups.

45,35132841,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the most important global issue since December 2019. Although the clinical course of COVID-19 is known to be milder in children than in adults, associated hospitalizations among children have increased since the emergence of contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and the achievement of a high vaccination rate in adults. Considering these global and domestic situations, we believe that risk stratification in children with COVID-19 is urgently needed for decision making regarding hospitalization priority in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccination priority against COVID-19. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed by comprehensively searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and KoreaMed databases through August 25, 2021. The criteria for enrollment were ""severe COVID-19"" as poor outcomes (intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and/or death) and underlying comorbidities before SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Among 872 screened studies, 17 articles were included in the systematic review, and 10 articles were included in the meta-analysis. Neonate (risk ratio [RR], 2.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-3.97), prematurity in young infants (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.63-2.46), obesity (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.24-1.64), diabetes (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.95-2.62), chronic lung disease (RR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.71-4.00), heart disease (RR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.58-2.09), neurologic disease (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.33), and immunocompromised status (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01-2.04) were significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children. In the subgroup analysis, age younger than 3 months (RR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.11-0.66), asthma (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.98-1.20), and neurodevelopmental disorders (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75-1.04) were not risk factors for severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Children with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung diseases other than asthma, seizure disorders, and an immunocompromised status had a high prevalence of severe COVID-19. Neonate and premature infants had a high risk of severe COVID-19.

Neonate (risk ratio [RR], 2.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-3.97), prematurity in young infants (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.63-2.46), obesity (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.24-1.64), diabetes (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.95-2.62), chronic lung disease (RR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.71-4.00), heart disease (RR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.58-2.09), neurologic disease (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.33), and immunocompromised status (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01-2.04) were significant risk factors for severe COVID-19 in children. In the subgroup analysis, age younger than 3 months (RR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.11-0.66), asthma (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.98-1.20), and neurodevelopmental disorders (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75-1.04) were not risk factors for severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Children with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung diseases other than asthma, seizure disorders, and an immunocompromised status had a high prevalence of severe COVID-19. Neonate and premature infants had a high risk of severe COVID-19.

46,35132602,"INTRODUCTION: Emerging data have demonstrated increased mortality of COVID-19 patients suffering from comorbid conditions such as Type II diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Underlying risk in all these patients is an increase in bodyweight or obesity. The adverse health effects of obesity and how these factors enhance the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients is still unexplored. OBJECTIVE: The enhanced fat deposition might be a risk factor for increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHOD: We have reviewed and collected the information from online databases: Pubmed, Google scholar, Researchgate, to highlight the systematic link between obesity with associated risks in COVID-19. RESULT: We have reported the first study during the pandemic from France and New York, to a currently reported study in Mexico and found individuals with BMI >/=35 kg/m(2) or >40 kg/m(2) have greater risk of developing critical illness due to COVID-19, thereby increasing mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests obesity in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood can be considered a profound risk factor for greater susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 and is associated with nutritional, lifestyle, cardiac, respiratory, renal, and immunological alterations, which may potentiate the complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further suggesting to check on BMI during this pandemic situation.","INTRODUCTION: Emerging data have demonstrated increased mortality of COVID-19 patients suffering from comorbid conditions such as Type II diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases.

47,35120577,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused millions of deaths, and new treatments are urgently needed. Factors associated with a worse COVID-19 prognosis include old age (> 65 years), ethnicity, male sex, obesity, and people with comorbidities. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency was reported as a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. According to a recent clinical case series, vitamin D deficiency is a modifiable risk factor, which has the prospect of reducing hospital stay, intensive care, and fatal outcomes. Vitamin D has potent immunomodulatory properties, and its supplementation might improve important outcomes in critically ill and vitamin D-deficient COVID-19 patients. Despite the evidence that supports an association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity, there is uncertainty about the direct link. Therefore, the aim of the trial is to assess if high-dose vitamin D supplementation has a therapeutic effect in vitamin D-deficient patients with COVID-19. METHODS: As the trial design, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center approach was chosen to compare a high single dose of vitamin D (140,000 IU) followed by treatment as usual (TAU) (VitD + TAU) with treatment as usual only (placebo + TAU) in patients with COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency. DISCUSSION: Vitamin D substitution in patients with COVID-19 and vitamin D deficiency should be investigated for efficacy and safety. The study aim is to test the hypothesis that patients with vitamin D deficiency suffering from COVID-19 treated under standardized conditions in hospital will recover faster when additionally treated with high-dose vitamin D supplementation. Latest studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation in patients with COVID-19 is highly recommended to positively influence the course of the disease. With this randomized controlled trial, a contribution to new treatment guidelines shall be made.

48,35120165,"BACKGROUND: Infection by the SARS-Cov-2 virus produces in humans a disease of highly variable and unpredictable severity. The presence of frequent genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the population might lead to a greater susceptibility to infection or an exaggerated inflammatory response. SARS-CoV-2 requires the presence of the ACE2 protein to enter in the cell and ACE2 is a regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. Accordingly, we studied the associations between 8 SNPs from AGTR1, ACE2 and ACE genes and the severity of the disease produced by the SARS-Cov-2 virus. METHODS: 318 (aged 59.6+/-17.3 years, males 62.6%) COVID-19 patients were grouped based on the severity of symptoms: Outpatients (n = 104, 32.7%), hospitalized on the wards (n = 73, 23.0%), Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (n = 84, 26.4%) and deceased (n = 57, 17.9%). Comorbidity data (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, lung disease and cancer) were collected for adjustment. Genotype distribution of 8 selected SNPs among the severity groups was analyzed. RESULTS: Four SNPs in ACE2 were associated with the severity of disease. While rs2074192 andrs1978124showed a protector effectassuming an overdominant model of inheritance (G/A vs. GG-AA, OR = 0.32, 95%CI = 0.12-0.82; p = 0.016 and A/G vs. AA-GG, OR = 0.37, 95%CI: 0.14-0.96; p = 0.038, respectively); the SNPs rs2106809 and rs2285666were associated with an increased risk of being hospitalized and a severity course of the disease with recessive models of inheritance (C/C vs. T/C-T/T, OR = 11.41, 95% CI: 1.12-115.91; p = 0.012) and (A/A vs. GG-G/A, OR = 12.61, 95% CI: 1.26-125.87; p = 0.0081). As expected, an older age (OR = 1.47), male gender (OR = 1.98) and comorbidities (OR = 2.52) increased the risk of being admitted to ICU or death vs more benign outpatient course. Multivariable analysis demonstrated the role of the certain genotypes (ACE2) with the severity of COVID-19 (OR: 0.31, OR 0.37 for rs2074192 and rs1978124, and OR = 2.67, OR = 2.70 for rs2106809 and rs2285666, respectively). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in hospitalized group for I/D SNP in ACE was not showed (p<0.05), which might be due to the association with the disease. No association between COVID-19 disease and the different AGTR1 SNPs was evidenced on multivariable, nevertheless the A/A genotype for rs5183 showed an higher hospitalization risk in patients with comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Different genetic variants in ACE2 were associated with a severe clinical course and death groups of patients with COVID-19. ACE2 common SNPs in the population might modulate severity of COVID-19 infection independently of other known markers like gender, age and comorbidities.","BACKGROUND: Infection by the SARS-Cov-2 virus produces in humans a disease of highly variable and unpredictable severity.

54,35080700,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the real influence of bariatric surgery on the clinical evolution of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in the postoperative period. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis including two groups of patients: those who presented COVID-19 before bariatric surgery and those who presented it within 3 months of postoperative. Primary outcome was related to the severity of COVID-19, measured by the following variables: presence of symptoms, need for hospitalization, ICU admission, and invasive ventilation. Laboratory markers for inflammatory response, glycemic status, and micronutrients were analyzed as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: From the 222 individuals operated on within the study period, only 66 (29.7%) presented COVID-19, 42 (18.9%) in the preoperative period and 24 (10.8%) after the procedure. Mean age was 36.3 +/- 9.5 years and mean preoperative BMI was 39.9 +/- 4.2 kg/m(2). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups regarding symptoms presentation (92.9% x 87.5%, p = 0.66), need for hospitalization (11.9% x 16.7%, p = 0.713), ICU admission (4.8% x 4.2%, p = 1.000), and invasive ventilation (2.4% x 0.0%, p = 1.000). Regarding the quantitative variables, absolute lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the group who presented COVID-19 after surgery (1822.9 +/- 482.2 x 2158.6 +/- 552.9, p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Patients who had COVID-19 before and after sleeve gastrectomy did not differ with statistical significance for the presence of symptoms, need for hospitalization, ICU admission, and invasive ventilation.","PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the real influence of bariatric surgery on the clinical evolution of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 in the postoperative period.

57,35051686,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Molnupiravir is a newer oral antiviral drug that has recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) in USA, UK and India. We aim to conduct an update on our previous systematic review to provide practical clinical guideline for using molnupiravir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched the electronic database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar until January 5, 2022, using key MeSH keywords. RESULTS: Final result of phase 3 study in 1433 non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed a significant reduction in composite risk of hospital admission or death (absolute risk difference, -3.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, -5.9 to -0.1%]; 1-sided P = 0.02) although with a non-significant 31% relative risk reduction (RRR). RRR for death alone was 89% (95% CI, 14 to 99; P-value not reported). Number needed to treat to prevent 1 death or 1 hospitalization or death composite appears to be closely competitive to other agents having EUA in people with COVID-19. However, cost-wise molnupiravir is comparatively cheaper compared to all other agents. CONCLUSION: Molnupiravir could be a useful agent in non-pregnant unvaccinated adults with COVID-19 who are at increased risk of severity including hospitalization. However, it is effective only when used within 5-days of onset of symptoms. A 5-days course seems to be safe without any obvious short-term side effects.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Molnupiravir is a newer oral antiviral drug that has recently received emergency use authorization (EUA) in USA, UK and India.

58,35048549,"OBJECTIVE: The triad of obesity, a high-protein diet from animal sources, and disturbed gut microbiota have been linked to poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. In this report, the effect of oxidative stress resulting from the Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase transporter signaling cascade is explored as a driver of this poor clinical outcome. METHODS: Protein-protein interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome were identified from the interactome data for Na(+) /K(+) -transporting ATPase subunit alpha-1 (ATP1A1), epidermal growth factor receptor, and ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2, using the curated data from the BioGRID Database of Protein Interactions. Data for the gene expression pattern of inflammatory response were from the Gene Expression Omnibus database for cardiomyocytes post SARS-CoV-2 infection (number GSE151879). RESULTS: The ATP1A1 subunit of the Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase transporter is targeted by multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Furthermore, receptor proteins associated with inflammatory response, including epidermal growth factor receptor and ERB-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (which interact with ATP1A1), are also targeted by some SARS-CoV-2 proteins. This heightened interaction likely triggers a cytokine release that increases the severity of the viral infection in individuals with obesity. CONCLUSIONS: The similarities between the effects of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and indoxyl sulphate on the Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase transporter signaling cascade suggest the possibility of an augmentation of gene changes seen with COVID-19 infection that can result in a hyperinduction of cytokine release in individuals with obesity.","OBJECTIVE: The triad of obesity, a high-protein diet from animal sources, and disturbed gut microbiota have been linked to poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: One hundred forty outpatients with MG followed between March 2020 and April 2021 were included in our study. Patients were asked to respond to a brief questionnaire in person, by telemedicine, or through electronic messages. RESULTS: Nineteen patients tested positive for COVID-19 by polymerase chain reaction. Two were asymptomatic. Of the 17 symptomatic patients, 11 had mild symptoms. They either had no treatment or received antivirals, antibiotics, and anticoagulants. Their myasthenia was well-controlled before infection and was unaffected by COVID-19. Three patients with moderate COVID-19 required hospitalization, but not intensive care, and had full recovery. Three other patients, the oldest in the cohort, had severe disease: One patient with a postsurgery myasthenic exacerbation before the infection needed intensive care without intubation, but recovered completely; two morbidly obese patients with comorbidities required intubation and died.

60,35031644,"Although male Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients have higher Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rates and a worse disease course, a comprehensive analysis of female and male ICU survival and underlying factors such as comorbidities, risk factors, and/or anti-infection/inflammatory therapy administration is currently lacking. Therefore, we investigated the association between sex and ICU survival, adjusting for these and other variables. In this multicenter observational cohort study, all patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to seven ICUs in one region across Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany, and requiring vital organ support during the first pandemic wave were included. With a random intercept for a center, mixed-effects logistic regression was used to investigate the association between sex and ICU survival. Models were adjusted for age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, comorbidities, and anti-infection/inflammatory therapy. Interaction terms were added to investigate effect modifications by sex with country and sex with obesity. A total of 551 patients (29% were females) were included. Mean age was 65.4 +/- 11.2 years. Females were more often obese and smoked less frequently than males (p-value 0.001 and 0.042, respectively). APACHE II scores of females and males were comparable. Overall, ICU mortality was 12% lower in females than males (27% vs 39% respectively, p-value < 0.01) with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.62 (95%CI 0.39-0.96, p-value 0.032) after adjustment for age and APACHE II score, 0.63 (95%CI 0.40-0.99, p-value 0.044) after additional adjustment for comorbidities, and 0.63 (95%CI 0.39-0.99, p-value 0.047) after adjustment for anti-infection/inflammatory therapy. No effect modifications by sex with country and sex with obesity were found (p-values for interaction > 0.23 and 0.84, respectively). ICU survival in female SARS-CoV-2 patients was higher than in male patients, independent of age, disease severity, smoking, obesity, comorbidities, anti-infection/inflammatory therapy, and country. Sex-specific biological mechanisms may play a role, emphasizing the need to address diversity, such as more sex-specific prediction, prognostic, and therapeutic approach strategies.","Although male Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients have higher Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rates and a worse disease course, a comprehensive analysis of female and male ICU survival and underlying factors such as comorbidities, risk factors, and/or anti-infection/inflammatory therapy administration is currently lacking.

In this multicenter observational cohort study, all patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to seven ICUs in one region across Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany, and requiring vital organ support during the first pandemic wave were included. With a random intercept for a center, mixed-effects logistic regression was used to investigate the association between sex and ICU survival. Models were adjusted for age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, comorbidities, and anti-infection/inflammatory therapy. Interaction terms were added to investigate effect modifications by sex with country and sex with obesity. A total of 551 patients (29% were females) were included. Mean age was 65.4 +/- 11.2 years. Females were more often obese and smoked less frequently than males (p-value 0.001 and 0.042, respectively). APACHE II scores of females and males were comparable. Overall, ICU mortality was 12% lower in females than males (27% vs 39% respectively, p-value < 0.01) with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.62 (95%CI 0.39-0.96, p-value 0.032) after adjustment for age and APACHE II score, 0.63 (95%CI 0.40-0.99, p-value 0.044) after additional adjustment for comorbidities, and 0.63 (95%CI 0.39-0.99, p-value 0.047) after adjustment for anti-infection/inflammatory therapy. No effect modifications by sex with country and sex with obesity were found (p-values for interaction > 0.23 and 0.84, respectively). ICU survival in female SARS-CoV-2 patients was higher than in male patients, independent of age, disease severity, smoking, obesity, comorbidities, anti-infection/inflammatory therapy, and country.

61,35024546,"COVID-19 is an inflammatory syndrome caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms range from mild infection to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring ventilation and intensive care. At the time of data collection, UK cases were around 300 000 with a fatality rate of 13% necessitating over 10 000 critical care admissions; now there have been over 4 million cases. Nutrition is important to immune function and influences metabolic risk factors such as obesity and glycaemic control, as well as recovery from acute illnesses. Poor nutritional status is associated with worse outcomes in ARDS and viral infections, yet limited research has assessed pre-morbid nutritional status and outcomes in patients critically unwell with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the effect of body mass index (BMI), glycaemic control and vitamin D status on outcomes in adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Retrospective review of all patients admitted to a central London ICU between March and May 2020 with confirmed COVID-19. Electronic patient records data were analysed for patient demographics; comorbidities; admission BMI; and serum vitamin D, zinc, selenium and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) concentrations. Serum vitamin D and HbA1c were measured on admission, or within 1 month of admission to ICU. Primary outcome of interest was mortality. Secondary outcomes included time intubated, ICU stay duration and ICU-related morbidity. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients; 54 (75%) men, mean age 57.1 (+/-9.8) years, were included. Overall, mortality was 24 (33%). No significant association with mortality was observed across BMI categories. In the survival arm admission, HbA1c (mmol/mol) was lower, 50.2 vs 60.8, but this was not statistically significant. Vitamin D status did not significantly associate with mortality (p=0.131). However, 32% of patients with low vitamin D (<25 IU/L) died, compared with 13% of patients with vitamin D levels >26 IU/L. Serum zinc and selenium, and vitamin B12 and folate levels were measured in 46% and 26% of patients, respectively. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Increased adiposity and deranged glucose homeostasis may potentially increase risk of COVID-19 infection and severity, possibly relating to impaired lung and metabolic function, increased proinflammatory and prothrombotic mechanisms. Vitamin D deficiency may also associate with poorer outcomes and mortality, supporting a possible role of vitamin D in immune function specific to pulmonary inflammation and COVID-19 pathophysiology. There are plausible associations between raised BMI, glycaemic control, vitamin D status and poor prognosis, as seen in wider studies; however, in this service evaluation audit during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK, with a limited data set available for this analysis, the associations did not reach statistical significance.

62,35023305,"OBJECTIVE: Overweight and obesity have been identified as risk factors for severe COVID-19; however, prospective cohort studies investigating the association between overweight early in life and severity of COVID-19 are lacking. METHODS: This study included 1,551,670 Swedish men, born between 1950 and 1987, with BMI registered at age 18 years. They were followed until January 9, 2021. COVID-19 cases and comorbidities were identified through the National Patient, Intensive Care, and Cause of Death registries. Outcomes included the following: 1) hospitalization; 2) intensive care unit admission; and 3) death. RESULTS: The study found 4,315 cases (mean age = 56.4 years [SD 8.8]) of patients hospitalized because of COVID-19, of which 729 were admitted to an intensive care unit, and altogether there were 224 deaths. The risk for hospital admission increased with higher values of BMI at age 18 years, despite adjustment for comorbidities, from an odds ratio (OR) of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08-1.31) at BMI = 22.5 to 25 to an OR of 1.68 (95% CI: 1.39-2.02) at BMI >/= 30, compared with BMI = 18.5 to 20.

63,35021250,"The clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is often complicated by the onset of venous thrombosis and thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing also pulmonary thrombosis. Recent statistics attests that the cumulative frequency of VTE can be as high as 30% in COVID-19 hospitalized patients, increasing to nearly 40 to 70% (depending on systematic screening) in those with severe illness, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission. The risk of venous thrombosis seems mostly limited to the active phase of disease, and is directly associated with some genetic (i.e., inherited prothrombotic predisposition) and demographical factors (male sex, overweight/obesity), disease severity (risk increasing progressively from hospitalization to development of severe illness, being the highest in patients needing mechanical ventilation and/or intensive care), presence and extent of pulmonary disease, coexistence of multiple risk factors (immobilization, mechanical ventilation, co- or superinfections), along with increased values of inflammatory and thrombotic biomarkers. At least three different phenotypes of pulmonary thrombosis may develop in COVID-19 patients, one caused by typical embolization from peripheral venous thrombosis (e.g., deep vein thrombosis), a second type triggered by local inflammation of nearby pulmonary tissue, and a third one mostly attributable to the prothrombotic state consequent to the pronounced systemic inflammatory response (i.e., the so-called cytokine storm) that is frequently observed in COVID-19. Although the pathogenesis of these three conditions has different features, their discrimination is essential for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The prognosis of COVID-19 patients who develop pulmonary thrombosis is also considerably worse than those who do not, thus probably needing frequent monitoring and more aggressive therapeutic management.","The clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is often complicated by the onset of venous thrombosis and thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing also pulmonary thrombosis.

Methods: This retrospective study included adult patients who tested for COVID-19 at an academic tertiary care institution between March 8, 2020, and May 17, 2020. Metabolic syndrome was defined by the modified World Health Organization criteria. Outcomes of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death were analyzed. Results: There were 23,282 patients who tested for COVID-19 and 3679 (15.8%) had a positive result. Of these, metabolic syndrome was present in 834 (39%) of 2139 patients with available data. Patients with metabolic syndrome tended to be older, male, African American, heavier, and with more comorbidities.

Collected data included gender, age, school name, native place, grade, major, body mass index (BMI), the scores of self-assessment lists of sleep (SRSS), Zung self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and Zung depression self-rating scale (SDS). RESULTS: 1445 valid questionnaires (99.18%) were received. Of all the respondents, the prevalence of insomnia, overweight and obesity, anxiety and depression were 32.73%, 19.45%, 15.43% and 62.91%, respectively. Female students were more likely to have insomnia and anxiety than male students. The rate of insomnia, overweight and obesity in postgraduates were higher than undergraduates. Non-medical students were more likely to be overweight and obese than medical students. In addition, insomnia severity was positively correlated to anxiety severity, and BMI was positively correlated to anxiety or depression severity. There was also a positive correlation between the severity of anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: During the post-pandemic era, insomnia and depression are common problems among college students in Wuhan, suggesting that we should strengthen the sleep education of college students to improve sleeping disorders and psychosomatic health.","OBJECTIVE: Wuhan was the first Chinese city to be lockdown for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in springtime of 2020.

66,34989117,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are independent risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Skewed cellular metabolism shapes immune cell inflammatory responsiveness and function in obesity, T2D, and infection. However, altered immune cell responsiveness and levels of systemic proinflammatory mediators, partly independent of peripheral immune cell contribution, are linked with SARS-CoV-2-associated disease severity. Despite such knowledge, the role of tissue parenchymal cell-driven inflammatory responses, and specifically those dominantly modified in obesity (e.g., adipocytes), in influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection pathogenesis remain poorly defined. Whether obesity-dependent skewing of adipocyte cellular metabolism uncovers inflammatory clades and promotes the existence of a 'pathogenic-inflammatory' adipocyte phenotype that amplifies SARS-CoV-2 infection diseases severity in individuals with obesity and individuals with obesity and T2D has not been examined. Here, using the knowledge gained from studies of immune cell responses in obesity, T2D, and infection, we highlight the key knowledge gaps underlying adipocyte cellular functions that may sculpt and grease pathogenic processes associated with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 disease severity in diabetes.","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are independent risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In this study, we evaluated immune and endothelial blood cell profiles of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to determine critical differences between those with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 using spectral flow cytometry. We examined a suite of immune phenotypes, including monocytes, T cells, NK cells, B cells, endothelial cells, and neutrophils, alongside surface and intracellular markers of activation. Our results showed progressive lymphopenia and depletion of T cell subsets (CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+)) in patients with severe disease and a significant increase in the CD56(+)CD14(+)Ki67(+)IFN-gamma(+) monocyte population in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 that has not been previously described. Enhanced circulating endothelial cells (CD45(-)CD31(+)CD34(+)CD146(+)), circulating endothelial progenitors (CD45(-)CD31(+)CD34(+/-)CD146(-)), and neutrophils (CD11b(+)CD66b(+)) were coevaluated for COVID-19 severity. Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated the synergism among age, obesity, and hypertension with upregulated CD56(+) monocytes, endothelial cells, and decreased T cells that lead to severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Circulating monocytes and endothelial cells may represent important cellular markers for monitoring postacute sequelae and impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection during convalescence and for their role in immune host defense in high-risk adults after vaccination.","Immune response dysregulation plays a key role in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogenesis.

70,34964827,"IMPORTANCE: Obesity is an established risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection. However, it is not known whether losing weight is associated with reduced adverse outcomes of COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between a successful weight loss intervention and improved risk and severity of COVID-19 infection in patients with obesity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study involved adult patients with a body mass index of 35 or higher (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) who underwent weight loss surgery between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2017, at the Cleveland Clinic Health System (CCHS). Patients in the surgical group were matched 1:3 to patients who did not have surgical intervention for their obesity (control group). The source of data was the CCHS electronic health record. Follow-up was conducted through March 1, 2021. EXPOSURES: Weight loss surgery including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Distinct outcomes were examined before and after COVID-19 outbreak on March 1, 2020. Weight loss and all-cause mortality were assessed between the enrollment date and March 1, 2020. Four COVID-19-related outcomes were analyzed in patients with COVID-19 diagnosis between March 1, 2020, and March 1, 2021: positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, hospitalization, need for supplemental oxygen, and severe COVID-19 infection (a composite of intensive care unit admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death). RESULTS: A total of 20212 patients (median [IQR] age, 46 [35-57] years; 77.6% female individuals [15 690]) with a median (IQR) body mass index of 45 (41-51) were enrolled. The overall median (IQR) follow-up duration was 6.1 (3.8-9.0) years. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, patients in the surgical group compared with control patients lost more weight (mean difference at 10 years from baseline: 18.6 [95% CI, 18.4-18.7] percentage points; P < .001) and had a 53% lower 10-year cumulative incidence of all-cause non-COVID-19 mortality (4.7% [95% CI, 3.7%-5.7%] vs 9.4% [95% CI, 8.7%-10.1%]; P < .001). Of the 20212 enrolled patients, 11809 were available on March 1, 2020, for an assessment of COVID-19-related outcomes. The rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were comparable in the surgical and control groups (9.1% [95% CI, 7.9%-10.3%] vs 8.7% [95% CI, 8.0%-9.3%]; P = .71). However, undergoing weight loss surgery was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.35-0.76; P < .001), need for supplemental oxygen (adjusted HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.23-0.61; P < .001), and severe COVID-19 infection (adjusted HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18-0.86; P = .02).

METHODS: Confirmed disease was defined as any patient with a positive antigen test, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, or serology for SARS-CoV-2. We compared the characteristics of patients with mild disease (asymptomatic included) with those with moderate or severe disease (requiring admission). RESULTS: Of 2344 HIV-infected patients, 158 (82.9% male; median age, 46.5 years) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 (infection rate, 6.74%; 95% confidence interval, 5.79 to 7.83). Thirty-nine individuals (24.7%) had moderate or severe disease, 43.7% had mild disease, and 31.6% were asymptomatic. Hypertension (23.4%) and obesity (15.8%) were the most prevalent comorbidities; 12.7% had at least 2 comorbidities. One hundred forty-five patients (97.3%) had RNA-HIV viral load of <50 copies per milliliter, and only 3 had CD4 cell count of <200 cells per cubic millimeter before infection. Of those admitted to hospital, 59% required oxygen support and 15.4%, invasive mechanical ventilation. Five patients died. None of the patient taking tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate required admission.

This study estimates the per-patient cost of inpatient care for adult COVID-19 patients seen at >800 US hospitals. METHODS: Patients aged >/=18 years with >/=1 hospitalization during March 2020-July 2021 with a COVID-19 diagnosis code in a large electronic administrative discharge database were included. We used validated costs when reported; otherwise, costs were calculated using charges multiplied by cost-to-charge ratios. We estimated costs of inpatient care per patient overall and by severity indicator, age, sex, underlying medical conditions, and acute complications of COVID-19 using a generalized linear model with log link function and gamma distribution. RESULTS: The overall cost among 654673 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was $16.2 billion. Estimated per-patient hospitalization cost was $24 826. Among surviving patients, estimated per-patient cost was $13 090 without intensive care unit (ICU) admission or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), $21 222 with ICU admission alone, and $59 742 with IMV. Estimated per-patient cost among patients who died was $27 017. Adjusted cost differential was higher among patients with certain underlying conditions (eg, chronic kidney disease [$12 391], liver disease [$8878], cerebrovascular disease [$7267], and obesity [$5933]) and acute complications (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome [$43 912], pneumothorax [$25 240], and intracranial hemorrhage [$22 280]). CONCLUSIONS: The cost of inpatient care for COVID-19 patients was substantial through the first 17 months of the pandemic.

76,34935038,"OBJECTIVES: Describe population-based rates and risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (ie, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death) among hospitalized children. METHODS: During March 2020 to May 2021, the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network identified 3106 children hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in 14 states. Among 2293 children primarily admitted for COVID-19, multivariable generalized estimating equations generated adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the associations between demographic and medical characteristics abstracted from medical records and severe COVID-19. We calculated age-adjusted cumulative population-based rates of severe COVID-19 among all children. RESULTS: Approximately 30% of hospitalized children had severe COVID-19; 0.5% died during hospitalization. Among hospitalized children aged <2 years, chronic lung disease (aRR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1-4.3), neurologic disorders (aRR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.52.6), cardiovascular disease (aRR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.22.3), prematurity (aRR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.12.2), and airway abnormality (aRR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.12.2) were associated with severe COVID-19. Among hospitalized children aged 2 to 17 years, feeding tube dependence (aRR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.52.5), diabetes mellitus (aRR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.62.3) and obesity (aRR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.01.4) were associated with severe COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 occurred among 12.0 per 100 000 children overall and was highest among infants, Hispanic children, and non-Hispanic Black children. CONCLUSIONS: Results identify children at potentially higher risk of severe COVID-19 who may benefit from prevention efforts, including vaccination.

79,34893021,"BACKGROUND: Clarification of the risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity is strongly warranted for global health. Recent studies have indicated that elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with unfavorable progression of COVID-19. This is assumed to be due to excessive deposition of visceral adipose tissue (VAT); however, the evidence investigating the association between intra-abdominal fat and COVID-19 prognosis is sparse. We therefore investigated whether measuring the amount of intra-abdominal fat is useful to predict the prognosis of COVID-19. METHODS: The present study enrolled 53 consecutive cases of COVID-19 patients aged >/= 20 years with chest computed tomography (CT) scans. The VAT area, total adipose tissue (TAT) area, and VAT/TAT ratio were estimated using axial CT images at the level of the upper pole of the right kidney. Severe COVID-19 was defined as death or acute respiratory failure demanding oxygen at >/= 6 L per minute, a high-flow nasal cannula, or mechanical ventilation. The association of VAT/TAT with the incidence of progression to a severe state was estimated as a hazard ratio (HR) using Cox regression analysis. To compare the prediction ability for COVID-19 disease progression between BMI and VAT/TAT, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of each was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 15 cases (28.3% of the whole study subjects) progressed to severe stages. The incidence of developing severe COVID-19 increased significantly with VAT/TAT (HR per 1% increase = 1.040 (95% CI 1.008-1.074), P = 0.01). After adjustment for potential confounders, the positive association of VAT/TAT with COVID-19 aggravation remained significant (multivariable-adjusted HR = 1.055 (95% CI 1.000-1.112) per 1% increase, P = 0.049). The predictive ability of VAT/TAT for COVID-19 becoming severe was significantly better than that of BMI (AUC of 0.73 for VAT/TAT and 0.50 for BMI; P = 0.0495 for the difference). CONCLUSIONS: A higher ratio of VAT/TAT was an independent risk factor for disease progression among COVID-19 patients. VAT/TAT was superior to BMI in predicting COVID-19 morbidity. COVID-19 patients with high VAT/TAT levels should be carefully observed as high-risk individuals for morbidity and mortality.","BACKGROUND: Clarification of the risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity is strongly warranted for global health.

The predictive ability of VAT/TAT for COVID-19 becoming severe was significantly better than that of BMI (AUC of 0.73 for VAT/TAT and 0.50 for BMI; P = 0.0495 for the difference). CONCLUSIONS: A higher ratio of VAT/TAT was an independent risk factor for disease progression among COVID-19 patients. VAT/TAT was superior to BMI in predicting COVID-19 morbidity.

80,34887628,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease produced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it is currently causing a catastrophic pandemic affecting humans worldwide. This disease has been lethal for approximately 3.12 million people around the world since January 2020. Globally, among the most affected countries, Mexico ranks third in deaths after the United States of America and Brazil. Although the high number of deceased people might also be explained by social aspects and lifestyle customs in Mexico, there is a relationship between this high proportion of deaths and comorbidities such as high blood pressure (HBP), type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The official epidemiological figures reported by the Mexican government have indicated that 18.4% of the population suffers from HBP, close to 10.3% of adults suffer from type 2 diabetes, and approximately 36.1% of the population suffers from obesity. Disbalances in the gut microbiota (GM) have been associated with these diseases and with COVID-19 severity, presumably due to inflammatory dysfunction. Recent data about the association between GM dysbiosis and metabolic diseases could suggest that the high levels of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 morbidity in the Mexican population are primarily due to the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease produced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it is currently causing a catastrophic pandemic affecting humans worldwide.

81,34877270,"Inflammation is one of the primary factors associated with the causation and/or progression of several lifestyle disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a spectrum of disorders, and starts with simple steatosis, progresses to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and then advances to fibrosis, cirrhosis and finally, hepatocellular carcinoma, due to perpetual cycles of insults caused by inflammation and other cellular stress. Emerging evidence has documented that patients with NAFLD have severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and patients with COVID-19 have a higher liver injury and mortality. Although the exact cause or mechanism is not known, inflammatory cytokine storm is a characteristic feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and is known to be associated with higher mortality among COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be a major concern in NAFLD patients, who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop COVID-19. This is evident in patients at any stage of the NAFLD spectrum, as the inflammatory cytokine storm may cause and/or aggravate the progression or severity of NAFLD. Thus, there is a need for resolution of the inflammatory cytokine storm in these patients. A large body of evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 LCPUFA) in NAFLD conditions, due to their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-viral properties. Therefore, intervention with omega-3 LCPUFA, an effective pharmaconutrient along with the standard treatment for COVID-19 may be useful in the management of the NAFLD spectrum in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing NAFLD conditions by resolving the inflammatory cytokine storm and thereby attenuating its progression. Although there are challenges in implementation, optimistically they can be circumvented and the pharmaconutrition strategy may be potentially helpful in tackling both the pandemics; NAFLD and COVID-19 at least in this subset of patients.","Inflammation is one of the primary factors associated with the causation and/or progression of several lifestyle disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

82,34871158,"Background: Patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) have been postulated to be at increased risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection due to inherent dysregulation of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system. Only limited data have been available to explore this hypothesis. Objective: To assess the interrelationship(s) between COVID-19 and HAE. Methods: Self-reported COVID-19 infection, complications, morbidity, and mortality were surveyed by using an online questionnaire. The participants included subjects with HAE with C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency (HAE-C1INH) and subjects with HAE with normal C1-inhibitor (HAE-nl-C1INH), and household controls (normal controls). The impact of HAE medications was examined. Results: A total of 1162 participants who completed the survey were analyzed, including: 695 subjects with HAE-C1INH, 175 subjects with HAE-nl-C1INH, and 292 normal controls. The incidence of reported COVID-19 was not significantly different between the normal controls (9%) and the subjects with HAE-C1INH (11%) but was greater in the subjects with HAE-nl-C1INH (19%; p = 0.006). Obesity was positively correlated with COVID-19 across the overall population (p = 0.012), with a similar but nonsignificant trend in the subjects with HAE-C1INH. Comorbid autoimmune disease was a risk factor for COVID-19 in the subjects with HAE-C1INH (p = 0.047). COVID-19 severity and complications were similar in all the groups. Reported COVID-19 was reduced in the subjects with HAE-C1INH who received prophylactic subcutaneous C1INH (5.6%; p = 0.0371) or on-demand icatibant (7.8%; p = 0.0016). The subjects with HAE-C1INH and not on any HAE medications had an increased risk of COVID-19 compared with the normal controls (24.5%; p = 0.006). Conclusion: The subjects with HAE-C1INH who were not taking HAE medications had a significantly higher rate of reported COVID-19 infection. Subcutaneous C1INH and icatibant use were associated with a significantly reduced rate of reported COVID-19. The results implicated potential roles for the complement cascade and tissue kallikrein-kinin pathways in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in patients with HAE-C1INH.","Background: Patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) have been postulated to be at increased risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection due to inherent dysregulation of the plasma kallikrein-kinin system.

84,34865174,"BACKGROUND: In the absence of a vaccine, the global spread of COVID-19 during 2020 has necessitated non-pharmaceutical interventions to curb the rise of cases. PURPOSE: The article uses the health belief model and a novel rapid mobile survey to examine correlates of reported mask-wearing as a non-pharmaceutical intervention in South Africa between May and August 2020. METHODS: Two-way tabulations and multivariable analysis via logistic regression modeling describe correlations between reported mask-wearing and factors of interest among a sample of 7074 adults in a two-period national longitudinal survey, the National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM). RESULTS: In line with the health belief model, results showed that self-efficacy, the prevalence of others' mask-wearing in the same district, and affluence were positively associated with reported mask-wearing. Those who reported staying at home were significantly less likely to report wearing a mask. There was little evidence that the expected severity of the disease if contracted, affects these decisions. Hypertension, obesity, or being overweight (measured three years earlier) did not have a significant association with mask-wearing. The prevalence of mask-wearing increased significantly from May to August 2020 as COVID-19 cases increased and lockdown restrictions were eased. Contrary to the health belief model, we found that despite having a higher mortality risk, the elderly had significantly lower odds of mask-wearing. CONCLUSION: In South Africa, the mask-wearing adherence has increased rapidly. It is concerning that the elderly had lower odds of mask-wearing. This should be examined further in future research.","BACKGROUND: In the absence of a vaccine, the global spread of COVID-19 during 2020 has necessitated non-pharmaceutical interventions to curb the rise of cases.

Our specific aim was to approximate the prognosis of LT recipients with COVID-19 on the standard maintenance IS. Method: We searched separate databases for the qualified studies in between December 2019 and June 25, 2021. Ultimately, a meta-analysis was carried out using a fixed-effect or random-effect model based on the heterogeneity. Results: In a total of eight studies and 509 LT recipients with COVID-19, the pooled rates of severity and mortality during all the combined immunosuppressive therapies were 22.4 and 19.5%, respectively. Our study sufficiently showed that an immunosuppressive therapy in LT recipients with COVID-19 was significantly associated with a non-severe COVID-19 [odds ratio (OR): 11.49, 95% CI: 4.17-31.65; p < 0.001] and the survival of the patients (OR: 17.64, 95% CI: 12.85-24.22; p < 0.001). Moreover, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi) typically had the lowest rate of severity and mortality compared to other ISs such as calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), steroids, and antimetabolites, i.e., severity (13.5 vs. 21.1, 24.7, and 26.3%) and mortality (8.3 vs. 15, 17.2, and 12.1%), respectively. Contrary to the general opinions, our meta-analysis showed comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiopulmonary disorders, chronic kidney disease (CKD), age >60, the duration of LT to the diagnosis of COVID-19, primary disease for LT, and obesity were not significantly associated with the severity and mortality in LT recipients with COVID-19 under an immunosuppressive therapy. However, our pooled analysis found that LT recipients with COVID-19 and without comorbidities have a less severe disease and low mortality rate compared to those with both COVID-19 and comorbidities. Conclusions: In conclusion, LT recipients with COVID-19 undergoing immunosuppressive therapies are not significantly associated with the severity and mortality. Therefore, taking the risk of organ rejection into a key consideration, a complete withdrawal of the IS may not be wise. However, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) might be discontinued or replaced from an immunosuppressive regimen with the CNIs- or mTORis-based immunosuppressive therapy in some selected LT recipients with COVID-19, depending upon the severity of the disease.","Background: The probable impact of a maintenance immunosuppressant (IS) on liver transplant (LT) recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unexplored.

87,34838054,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) and identify the risk factors associated with symptomatic or severe disease defined as hospital admission, intensive care admission or death. METHODS: An observational longitudinal study was conducted during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (March 2020-March 2021). All pediatric patients attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinics of six tertiary referral hospitals in Madrid, Spain, with a diagnosis of RMD and COVID-19 were included. Main outcomes were symptomatic disease and hospital admission. The covariates were sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and treatment regimens. We ran a multivariable logistic regression model to assess associated factors for outcomes. RESULTS: The study population included 77 pediatric patients. Mean age was 11.88 (4.04) years Of these, 30 patients (38.96%) were asymptomatic, 41 (53.25%) had a mild-moderate COVID-19 and 6 patients (7.79%) required hospital admission. The median length of hospital admission was 5 (2-20) days, one patient required intensive care and there were no deaths. Previous comorbidities increased the risk for symptomatic disease and hospital admission. Compared with outpatients, the factor independently associated with hospital admission was previous use of glucocorticoids (OR 3.51; p = 0.00). No statistically significant risk factors for symptomatic COVID-19 were found in the final model. CONCLUSION: No differences in COVID-19 outcomes according to childhood-onset rheumatic disease types were found. Results suggest that associated comorbidities and treatment with glucocorticoids increase the risk of hospital admission.","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) and identify the risk factors associated with symptomatic or severe disease defined as hospital admission, intensive care admission or death.

Even with the recent rollout of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and availability of medicines such as remdesivir, and monoclonal antibodies, host nutritional status is pivotal in the fight against the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and outcomes. The purpose of this review is to discuss the effects of COVID-19-related lockdown on lifestyle behaviors, and the nutritional consequences, and the direct sequelae of the infection on nutrition including potential nutritional interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19-related lockdown imposed radical changes in lifestyle behaviors with considerable short-term and long-term health and nutritional consequences including weight gain and obesity and increased cardiometabolic risk, consistently linked to worsened prognosis. The extent of the impact was dependent on food insecurity, overall stress and disordered eating, physical inactivity, and exposure to COVID-19-related nutrition information sources. COVID-19 could directly induce inflammatory responses and poor nutrient intake and absorption leading to undernutrition with micronutrient deficiencies, which impairs immune system function with subsequent amplified risk of infection and disease severity. Nutrition interventions through nutrition support, dietary supplementation, and home remedies such as use of zinc, selenium, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids showed the most significant promise to mitigate the course of COVID-19 infection and improve survival rates. The nutrition-COVID-19 relationship and related dietary changes mimic a vicious cycle of the double burden of malnutrition, both obesity and undernutrition with micronutrient deficiencies, which promote infection, disease progression, and potential death.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nutritional status is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, directly or indirectly.

89,34836751,"The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges to global health. Although the majority of COVID-19 patients exhibit mild-to-no symptoms, many patients develop severe disease and need immediate hospitalization, with most severe infections associated with a dysregulated immune response attributed to a cytokine storm. Epidemiological studies suggest that overall COVID-19 severity and morbidity correlate with underlying comorbidities, including diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and immunosuppressive conditions. Patients with such comorbidities exhibit elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress caused by an increased accumulation of angiotensin II and by activation of the NADPH oxidase pathway. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that oxidative stress coupled with the cytokine storm contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunopathogenesis by causing endotheliitis and endothelial cell dysfunction and by activating the blood clotting cascade that results in blood coagulation and microvascular thrombosis. In this review, we survey the mechanisms of how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces oxidative stress and the consequences of this stress on patient health. We further shed light on aspects of the host immunity that are crucial to prevent the disease during the early phase of infection. A better understanding of the disease pathophysiology as well as preventive measures aimed at lowering ROS levels may pave the way to mitigate SARS-CoV-2-induced complications and decrease mortality.","The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges to global health.

DESIGN: Non-drug, open label, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Capital Region and Region Zealand in Denmark from 6 October 2020 to 26 February 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Community dwelling adults, able to perform self-care, with a new SARS-CoV-2 infection (verified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests) and symptoms of covid-19. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomised to use PEP flute self-care in addition to usual care or have usual care only. Randomisation was based on permuted random blocks in a 1:1 ratio, stratified for sex and age (<60 or >/=60 years). The PEP self-care group was instructed to use a PEP flute three times per day during the 30 day intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was a change in symptom severity from baseline to day 30, as assessed by the self-reported COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) assessment test (CAT), which was adjusted for baseline values and stratification factors. Participants completed the CAT test questionnaire every day online. Secondary outcomes were self-reported urgent care visits due to covid-19, number of covid-19 related symptoms, and change in self-rated health, all within 30-days' follow-up. RESULTS: 378 participants were assigned to the PEP flute self-care intervention (n=190) or usual care only (n=188). In the PEP self-care group, the median number of days with PEP flute use was 21 days (interquartile range 13-25). For the intention-to-treat population, a group difference was observed in changes from baseline in CAT scores of -1.2 points (95% confidence interval -2.1 to -0.2; P=0.017) in favour of the PEP flute self-care group. At day 30, the PEP flute self-care group also reported less chest tightness, less dyspnoea, more vigour, and higher level of daily activities, but these differences were small, and no consistent effects were seen on the secondary outcomes. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In community dwelling adults with early covid-19, PEP flute self-care had a significant, yet marginal and uncertain clinical effect on respiratory symptom severity, as measured by CAT scores.

93,34800973,"BACKGROUND: To better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital healthcare, we studied activity in the emergency department (ED) and acute medicine department of a major UK hospital. METHODS: Electronic patient records for all adult patients attending ED (n = 243,667) or acute medicine (n = 82,899) during the pandemic (2020-2021) and prior year (2019) were analysed and compared. We studied parameters including severity, primary diagnoses, co-morbidity, admission rate, length of stay, bed occupancy, and mortality, with a focus on non-COVID-19 diseases. RESULTS: During the first wave of the pandemic, daily ED attendance fell by 37%, medical admissions by 30% and medical bed occupancy by 27%, but all returned to normal within a year. ED attendances and medical admissions fell across all age ranges; the greatest reductions were seen for younger adults in ED attendances, but in older adults for medical admissions. Compared to non-COVID-19 pandemic admissions, COVID-19 admissions were enriched for minority ethnic groups, for dementia, obesity and diabetes, but had lower rates of malignancy. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, non-COVID-19 pandemic admissions had more hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, liver disease, and obesity. There were fewer low severity ED attendances during the pandemic and fewer medical admissions across all severity categories. There were fewer ED attendances with common non-respiratory illnesses including cardiac diagnoses, but no change in cardiac arrests. COVID-19 was the commonest diagnosis amongst medical admissions during the first wave and there were fewer diagnoses of pneumonia, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cellulitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, urinary tract infection and other sepsis, but not stroke. Levels had rebounded by a year later with a trend to higher levels of stroke than before the pandemic. During the pandemic first wave, 7-day mortality was increased for ED attendances, but not for non-COVID-19 medical admissions. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced ED attendances in the first wave of the pandemic suggest opportunities for reducing low severity presentations to ED in the future, but also raise the possibility of harm from delayed or missed care. Reassuringly, recent rises in attendance and admissions indicate that any deterrent effect of the pandemic on attendance is diminishing.","BACKGROUND: To better understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital healthcare, we studied activity in the emergency department (ED) and acute medicine department of a major UK hospital. METHODS: Electronic patient records for all adult patients attending ED (n = 243,667) or acute medicine (n = 82,899) during the pandemic (2020-2021) and prior year (2019) were analysed and compared. We studied parameters including severity, primary diagnoses, co-morbidity, admission rate, length of stay, bed occupancy, and mortality, with a focus on non-COVID-19 diseases. RESULTS: During the first wave of the pandemic, daily ED attendance fell by 37%, medical admissions by 30% and medical bed occupancy by 27%, but all returned to normal within a year. ED attendances and medical admissions fell across all age ranges; the greatest reductions were seen for younger adults in ED attendances, but in older adults for medical admissions. Compared to non-COVID-19 pandemic admissions, COVID-19 admissions were enriched for minority ethnic groups, for dementia, obesity and diabetes, but had lower rates of malignancy. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, non-COVID-19 pandemic admissions had more hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, liver disease, and obesity.

94,34789209,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted that individuals with behavioural risk factors commonly associated with non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as smoking, harmful alcohol use, obesity, and physical inactivity, are more likely to experience severe symptoms from COVID-19. These risk factors have been shown to increase the risk of NCDs, but less is known about their broader influence on communicable diseases. Taking a wide focus on a range of common communicable diseases, this review aimed to synthesise research examining the impact of behavioural risk factors commonly associated with NCDs on risks of contracting, or having more severe outcomes from, communicable diseases. METHODS: Literature searches identified systematic reviews and meta-analyses that examined the association between behavioural risk factors (alcohol, smoking, illicit drug use, physical inactivity, obesity and poor diet) and the contraction/severity of common communicable diseases, including infection or associated pathogens. An a priori, prospectively registered protocol was followed (PROSPERO; registration number CRD42020223890). RESULTS: Fifty-three systematic reviews were included, of which 36 were also meta-analyses. Reviews focused on: tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, invasive bacterial diseases, pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19. Twenty-one reviews examined the association between behavioural risk factors and communicable disease contraction and 35 examined their association with communicable disease outcomes (three examined their association with both contraction and outcomes). Fifty out of 53 reviews (94%) concluded that at least one of the behavioural risk factors studied increased the risk of contracting or experiencing worse health outcomes from a communicable disease. Across all reviews, effect sizes, where calculated, ranged from 0.83 to 8.22. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioural risk factors play a significant role in the risk of contracting and experiencing more severe outcomes from communicable diseases. Prevention of communicable diseases is likely to be most successful if it involves the prevention of behavioural risk factors commonly associated with NCDs. These findings are important for understanding risks associated with communicable disease, and timely, given the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for improvements in future pandemic preparedness. Addressing behavioural risk factors should be an important part of work to build resilience against any emerging and future epidemics and pandemics.","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted that individuals with behavioural risk factors commonly associated with non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as smoking, harmful alcohol use, obesity, and physical inactivity, are more likely to experience severe symptoms from COVID-19.

95,34777390,"Acute inflammation is a critical host defense response during viral infection. When dysregulated, inflammation drives immunopathology and tissue damage. Excessive, damaging inflammation is a hallmark of both pandemic influenza A virus (IAV) infections and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Chronic, low-grade inflammation is also a feature of obesity. In recent years, obesity has been recognized as a growing pandemic with significant mortality and associated costs. Obesity is also an independent risk factor for increased disease severity and death during both IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review focuses on the effect of obesity on the inflammatory response in the context of viral respiratory infections and how this leads to increased viral pathology. Here, we will review the fundamentals of inflammation, how it is initiated in IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection and its link to disease severity. We will examine how obesity drives chronic inflammation and trained immunity and how these impact the immune response to IAV and SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we review both medical and non-medical interventions for obesity, how they impact on the inflammatory response and how they could be used to prevent disease severity in obese patients. As projections of global obesity numbers show no sign of slowing down, future pandemic preparedness will require us to consider the metabolic health of the population. Furthermore, if weight-loss alone is insufficient to reduce the risk of increased respiratory virus-related mortality, closer attention must be paid to a patient's history of health, and new therapeutic options identified.","Acute inflammation is a critical host defense response during viral infection.

The virus primarily affects the upper and lower respiratory tracts and raises the risk of a variety of non-pulmonary consequences, the most severe and possibly fatal of which are cardiovascular problems. Data show that almost one-third of the patients with a moderate or severe form of COVID-19 had preexisting cardiovascular comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, heart failure, or coronary artery disease. SARS-CoV2 causes hyper inflammation, hypoxia, apoptosis, and a renin-angiotensin system imbalance in a variety of cell types, primarily endothelial cells. Profound endothelial dysfunction associated with COVID-19 can be the cause of impaired organ perfusion that may generate acute myocardial injury, renal failure, and a procoagulant state resulting in thromboembolic events. We discuss the most recent results on the involvement of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in patients with cardiometabolic diseases in this review.

97,34767594,"BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients vary greatly with age and underlying comorbidities. We aimed to determine the demographic and clinical factors, particularly baseline chronic conditions, associated with an increased risk of severity in COVID-19 patients from a population-based perspective and using data from electronic health records (EHR). METHODS: Retrospective, observational study in an open cohort analyzing all 68,913 individuals (mean age 44.4 years, 53.2% women) with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 15 June and 19 December 2020 using exhaustive electronic health registries. Patients were followed for 30 days from inclusion or until the date of death within that period. We performed multivariate logistic regression to analyze the association between each chronic disease and severe infection, based on hospitalization and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: 5885 (8.5%) individuals showed severe infection and old age was the most influencing factor. Congestive heart failure (odds ratio -OR- men: 1.28, OR women: 1.39), diabetes (1.37, 1.24), chronic renal failure (1.31, 1.22) and obesity (1.21, 1.26) increased the likelihood of severe infection in both sexes. Chronic skin ulcers (1.32), acute cerebrovascular disease (1.34), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.21), urinary incontinence (1.17) and neoplasms (1.26) in men, and infertility (1.87), obstructive sleep apnea (1.43), hepatic steatosis (1.43), rheumatoid arthritis (1.39) and menstrual disorders (1.18) in women were also associated with more severe outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Age and specific cardiovascular and metabolic diseases increased the risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in men and women, whereas the effects of certain comorbidities are sex specific. Future studies in different settings are encouraged to analyze which profiles of chronic patients are at higher risk of poor prognosis and should therefore be the targets of prevention and shielding strategies.","BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients vary greatly with age and underlying comorbidities.

99,34757409,"Importance: The influence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep-related hypoxemia in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and COVID-19 outcomes remains unknown. Controversy exists regarding whether to continue treatment for SDB with positive airway pressure given concern for aerosolization with limited data to inform professional society recommendations. Objective: To investigate the association of SDB (identified via polysomnogram) and sleep-related hypoxia with (1) SARS-CoV-2 positivity and (2) World Health Organization (WHO)-designated COVID-19 clinical outcomes while accounting for confounding including obesity, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, cancer, and smoking history. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control study was conducted within the Cleveland Clinic Health System (Ohio and Florida) and included all patients who were tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and November 30, 2020, and who had an available sleep study record. Sleep indices and SARS-CoV-2 positivity were assessed with overlap propensity score weighting, and COVID-19 clinical outcomes were assessed using the institutional registry. Exposures: Sleep study-identified SDB (defined by frequency of apneas and hypopneas using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI]) and sleep-related hypoxemia (percentage of total sleep time at <90% oxygen saturation [TST <90]). Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection and WHO-designated COVID-19 clinical outcomes (hospitalization, use of supplemental oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and death). Results: Of 350710 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, 5402 (mean [SD] age, 56.4 [14.5] years; 3005 women [55.6%]) had a prior sleep study, of whom 1935 (35.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 5402 participants, 1696 were Black (31.4%), 3259 were White (60.3%), and 822 were of other race or ethnicity (15.2%). Patients who were positive vs negative for SARS-CoV-2 had a higher AHI score (median, 16.2 events/h [IQR, 6.1-39.5 events/h] vs 13.6 events/h [IQR, 5.5-33.6 events/h]; P < .001) and increased TST <90 (median, 1.8% sleep time [IQR, 0.10%-12.8% sleep time] vs 1.4% sleep time [IQR, 0.10%-10.8% sleep time]; P = .02). After overlap propensity score-weighted logistic regression, no SDB measures were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Median TST <90 was associated with the WHO-designated COVID-19 ordinal clinical outcome scale (adjusted odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.10-1.74; P = .005). Time-to-event analyses showed sleep-related hypoxia associated with a 31% higher rate of hospitalization and mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08-1.57; P = .005). Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-control study, SDB and sleep-related hypoxia were not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 positivity; however, once patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2, sleep-related hypoxia was an associated risk factor for detrimental COVID-19 outcomes.","Importance: The influence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep-related hypoxemia in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and COVID-19 outcomes remains unknown.

Patients who were positive vs negative for SARS-CoV-2 had a higher AHI score (median, 16.2 events/h [IQR, 6.1-39.5 events/h] vs 13.6 events/h [IQR, 5.5-33.6 events/h]; P < .001) and increased TST <90 (median, 1.8% sleep time [IQR, 0.10%-12.8% sleep time] vs 1.4% sleep time [IQR, 0.10%-10.8% sleep time]; P = .02). After overlap propensity score-weighted logistic regression, no SDB measures were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Median TST <90 was associated with the WHO-designated COVID-19 ordinal clinical outcome scale (adjusted odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.10-1.74; P = .005). Time-to-event analyses showed sleep-related hypoxia associated with a 31% higher rate of hospitalization and mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08-1.57; P = .005). Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-control study, SDB and sleep-related hypoxia were not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 positivity; however, once patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2, sleep-related hypoxia was an associated risk factor for detrimental COVID-19 outcomes.",Pena Orbea C, A,Journal Article," Importance: The influence of<br>sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep-related hypoxemia<br>in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and COVID-19<br>outcomes remains unknown.

101,34730254,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease that varies in severity from mild to severe/fatal. Several risk factors for severe disease have been identified, notably age, male sex, and pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Several advancements in clinical care have been achieved over the past year, including the use of corticosteroids (e.g., corticosteroids) and other immune-modulatory treatments that have now become standard of care for patients with acute severe COVID-19. While the understanding of the mechanisms that underlie increased disease severity with age has improved over the past few months, it remains incomplete. Furthermore, the molecular impact of corticosteroid treatment on host response to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been investigated. In this study, a cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of Ab, soluble immune mediators, and transcriptional responses in young (65 </= years) and aged (>/= 65 years) diabetic males with obesity hospitalized with acute severe COVID-19 was conducted. Additionally, the transcriptional profiles in samples obtained before and after corticosteroids became standard of care were compared. The analysis indicates that severe COVID-19 is characterized by robust Ab responses, heightened systemic inflammation, increased expression of genes related to inflammatory and pro-apoptotic processes, and reduced expression of those important for adaptive immunity regardless of age. In contrast, COVID-19 patients receiving steroids did not show high levels of systemic immune mediators and lacked transcriptional indicators of heightened inflammatory and apoptotic responses. Overall, these data suggest that inflammation and cell death are key drivers of severe COVID-19 pathogenesis in the absence of corticosteroid therapy.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease that varies in severity from mild to severe/fatal.

102,34723346,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Prior to COVID-19, telemedicine and its applications to the emergency department (ED) had made significant inroads toward remote evaluation and care. During the local peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City (NYC), there was a dramatic increase in telemedicine based patient encounters for suspected COVID-19 symptoms. In response, pathways were developed to promote a standardized telemedicine approach to remote evaluation and assessment of suspected COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A pathway was developed and implemented at two academic EDs in NYC, which collectively had approximately 8,300 telemedicine visits for suspected COVID-19 from March 2020 to June 2020. A protocol was developed by an expert consensus panel of four board-certified emergency physicians and two pediatric emergency physicians, all with telemedicine training/administrative roles. RESULTS: The pathway was initiated for any telehealth patient with suspected COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, shortness of breath, and bodyaches). A standardized history solicited known or suspected risk factors for worse prognosis, including age > 50, cardiovascular or lung disease, obesity, immunosuppression, and living alone, as well as a focused assessment of symptom severity and exercise tolerance. An exam at rest included visual counting of breaths along with instruction on palpation of radial pulse. Saturation was included if pulse oximetry was available. If exam at rest was reassuring, providers were instructed to repeat the respiratory assessment on exertion by having the patient walk in place briskly for 1 minute. Patients with severe illness defined by resting or exertional respiratory rate greater than 30 and/or oxygen saturation less than 90 percent were instructed to go to the ED. Patients with moderate illness defined by exertional metrics of respiratory rate less than 22, oxygen saturation greater than 94 percent, and heart rate less than 125 were discharged from the virtual urgent care visit with a repeat telehealth follow-up call at either 12 or 24 hours depending on the number of risk factors. Patients without risk factors and with reassuring respiratory assessment were discharged from the telemedicine encounter with reassurance and standard discharge precautions for escalation of care. CONCLUSION: Designing and disseminating a standardized pathway helped to provide a framework to approach patients suspected of COVID-19 over telemedicine. Future work focusing on patient outcome data will help guide and refine any standardized telehealth approach to the COVID-19-suspected patient.","STUDY OBJECTIVES: Prior to COVID-19, telemedicine and its applications to the emergency department (ED) had made significant inroads toward remote evaluation and care.

Although population-wide inoculation is preferred, currently, there is large variation and disparity in the acquisition, development, and deployment of vaccination programs in many countries. Even with availability of a vaccine, achieving herd immunity does not guarantee against reinfection from SARS-CoV-2. Emerging evidence indicates that vaccines do not eliminate infection but protect against severe disease and potential hospitalisation. Therefore, additional strategies which strengthen the immune system should be strongly considered to assist in reducing the overall health care burden and stem the rate of infection. There is now substantial evidence that SARS-CoV-2 disease severity and death are linked to existing comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, and metabolic disorders.

107,34692741,"Introduction: As coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic, increasing numbers of reports have linked obesity to more severe COVID-19 illness and death. However, almost all the studies focused on an increased risk of mortality or intensive care unit (ICU) admission among hospitalized obese patients with COVID-19. Is obesity also associated with the incidence of acute lung injury (ALI) in the patients with COVID-19? How about underweight patients? The answer is lacking. Therefore, our following research will answer the above two questions. Methods: We collected and analyzed epidemiologic, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 193 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, between January 1, 2020, and March 13, 2020. They were followed up until April 15, 2020. Underweight was defined by body mass index (BMI) lower than 18.5 kg/m(2), normal weight by 18.5-23.9 kg/m(2), overweight by 24.0-27.9 kg/m(2), and obesity as >/=28 kg/m(2). Results: Among these patients, 5.70% were underweight, 58.03% were normal weight, 27.98% were overweight, and 8.29% were obese. Underweight patients were more likely to have a headache (P = 0.029). Obese patients were more likely than other groups to experience a decline in lymphocyte counts (P = 0.038), an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP; P = 0.023), bilateral multiple mottling, and ground glass opacity in the lungs (P = 0.007). Besides, the proportion of patients receiving human immunoglobulin + systematic corticosteroids treatment is the highest among the obese group compared with other BMI groups. After adjusting for potential confounders, underweight patients had a 6.483-fold higher (P = 0.012), and obese patients showed a 5.965-fold higher odds for developing ALI than normal-weight patients (P = 0.022). In addition, underweight patients were 3.255 times more likely than normal-weight patients to develop secondary infections (P = 0.041). Conclusions: Our study showed that both underweight and obese patients with COVID-19 tend to develop ALI compared with normal-weight patients. Underweight patients were more likely to develop a secondary infection than other patients.","Introduction: As coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic, increasing numbers of reports have linked obesity to more severe COVID-19 illness and death. However, almost all the studies focused on an increased risk of mortality or intensive care unit (ICU) admission among hospitalized obese patients with COVID-19. Is obesity also associated with the incidence of acute lung injury (ALI) in the patients with COVID-19? How about underweight patients? The answer is lacking. Therefore, our following research will answer the above two questions. Methods: We collected and analyzed epidemiologic, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 193 confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, between January 1, 2020, and March 13, 2020. They were followed up until April 15, 2020. Underweight was defined by body mass index (BMI) lower than 18.5 kg/m(2), normal weight by 18.5-23.9 kg/m(2), overweight by 24.0-27.9 kg/m(2), and obesity as >/=28 kg/m(2). Results: Among these patients, 5.70% were underweight, 58.03% were normal weight, 27.98% were overweight, and 8.29% were obese. Underweight patients were more likely to have a headache (P = 0.029). Obese patients were more likely than other groups to experience a decline in lymphocyte counts (P = 0.038), an increase in C-reactive protein (CRP; P = 0.023), bilateral multiple mottling, and ground glass opacity in the lungs (P = 0.007). Besides, the proportion of patients receiving human immunoglobulin + systematic corticosteroids treatment is the highest among the obese group compared with other BMI groups. After adjusting for potential confounders, underweight patients had a 6.483-fold higher (P = 0.012), and obese patients showed a 5.965-fold higher odds for developing ALI than normal-weight patients (P = 0.022). In addition, underweight patients were 3.255 times more likely than normal-weight patients to develop secondary infections (P = 0.041).

108,34687585,"OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this article was to describe SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women during the wild-type and Alpha-variant periods in Italy. The secondary aim was to compare the impact of the virus variants on the severity of maternal and perinatal outcomes. DESIGN: National population-based prospective cohort study. SETTING: A total of 315 Italian maternity hospitals. SAMPLE: A cohort of 3306 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed within 7 days of hospital admission. METHODS: Cases were prospectively reported by trained clinicians for each participating maternity unit. Data were described by univariate and multivariate analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 pneumonia, ventilatory support, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mode of delivery, preterm birth, stillbirth, and maternal and neonatal mortality. RESULTS: We found that 64.3% of the cohort was asymptomatic, 12.8% developed COVID-19 pneumonia and 3.3% required ventilatory support and/or ICU admission. Maternal age of 30-34 years (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.09-1.87) and >/=35 years (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.23-2.13), citizenship of countries with high migration pressure (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.36-2.25), previous comorbidities (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.13-1.98) and obesity (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.29-2.27) were all associated with a higher occurrence of pneumonia. The preterm birth rate was 11.1%. In comparison with the pre-pandemic period, stillbirths and maternal and neonatal deaths remained stable. The need for ventilatory support and/or ICU admission among women with pneumonia increased during the Alpha-variant period compared with the wild-type period (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.99-5.28). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with a low risk of severe COVID-19 disease among pregnant women and with rare adverse perinatal outcomes. During the Alpha-variant period there was a significant increase of severe COVID-19 illness.

109,34684358,"BACKGROUND: Obesity increases the severity of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes. Thus, this study tested whether obesogenic and ketogenic diets distinctly affect SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in rat pulmonary and cardiac tissues. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either standard chow (SC), a high-fat sucrose-enriched diet (HFS), or a ketogenic diet (KD) for 16 weeks. Afterwards, levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), RAS components, and inflammatory genes were measured in the lungs and hearts of these animals. RESULTS: In the lungs, HFS elevated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels relative to SC diet, whereas the KD lowered the levels of these proteins and the gene expressions of toll-like receptor 4 and interleukin-6 receptor relative to HFS. The diets did not alter ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the heart, although ACE2 was more abundant in heart than lung tissues. CONCLUSION: Diet-induced obesity increased the levels of viral entry proteins in the lungs, providing a mechanism whereby SARS-CoV-2 infectivity can be enhanced in obese individuals. Conversely, by maintaining low levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and by exerting an anti-inflammatory effect, the KD can potentially attenuate the severity of infection and migration of SARS-CoV-2 to other ACE2-expressing tissues.","BACKGROUND: Obesity increases the severity of SARS-CoV-2 outcomes.

111,34678637,"BACKGROUND: Age, sex, race and comorbidities are insufficient to explain why some individuals remain asymptomatic after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while others die. In this sense, the increased risk caused by the long-term exposure to air pollution is being investigated to understand the high heterogeneity of the COVID-19 infection course. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the underlying effect of long-term exposure to NO2 and PM10 on the severity and mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted with 2112 patients suffering COVID-19 infection. We built two sets of multivariate predictive models to assess the relationship between the long-term exposure to NO2 and PM10 and COVID-19 outcome. First, the probability of either death or severe COVID-19 outcome was predicted as a function of all the clinical variables together with the pollutants exposure by means of two regularized logistic regressions. Subsequently, two regularized linear regressions were constructed to predict the percentage of dead or severe patients. Finally, odds ratios and effects estimates were calculated. RESULTS: We found that the long-term exposure to PM10 is a more important variable than some already stated comorbidities (i.e.: COPD/Asthma, diabetes, obesity) in the prediction of COVID-19 severity and mortality. PM10 showed the highest effects estimates (1.65, 95% CI 1.32-2.06) on COVID-19 severity. For mortality, the highest effect estimates corresponded to age (3.59, 95% CI 2.94-4.40), followed by PM10 (2.37, 95% CI 1.71-3.32). Finally, an increase of 1 microg/m(3) in PM10 concentration causes an increase of 3.06% (95% CI 1.11%-4.25%) of patients suffering COVID-19 as a severe disease and an increase of 2.68% (95% CI 0.53%-5.58%) of deaths. DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that long-term PM10 burdens above WHO guidelines exacerbate COVID-19 health outcomes. Hence, WHO guidelines, the air quality standard established by the Directive 2008/50/EU, and that of the US-EPA should be updated accordingly to protect human health.","BACKGROUND: Age, sex, race and comorbidities are insufficient to explain why some individuals remain asymptomatic after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while others die.

113,34663823,"The Brazilian Northern region registered a high incidence of COVID-19 cases, particularly in the state of Para. The present study investigated the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 in a Brazilian Amazon region of 100,819 cases. An epidemiological, cross-sectional, analytical and demographic study, analyzing data on confirmed cases for COVID-19 available at the Brazilian Ministry of Health's surveillance platform, was conducted. Variables such as, municipalities of residence, age, gender, signs and symptoms, comorbidities were included and associated with COVID-19 cases and outcomes. The spatial distribution was performed using the ArcGIS program. A total of 100,819 cases were evaluated. Overall, patients had the mean age of 42.3 years, were female (51.2%) and with lethality reaching 4.79% of cases. Main symptoms included fever (66.5%), cough (61.9%) and sore throat (39.8%). Regarding comorbidities, most of the patients presented cardiovascular disease (5.1%) and diabetes (4.2%). Neurological disease increased risk of death by nearly 15 times, followed by obesity (5.16 times) and immunodeficiency (5.09 time). The municipalities with the highest incidence rate were Parauapebas, Canaa dos Carajas and Jacareacanga. Similarity between the Lower Amazon, Marajo and Southwest mesoregions of Para state were observed concerning the highest morbidity rates. The obtained data demonstrated that the majority of cases occurred among young adults, females, with the classic influenza symptoms and chronic diseases. Finally, data suggest that the highest incidences were no longer in the metropolitan region of the state.

An epidemiological, cross-sectional, analytical and demographic study, analyzing data on confirmed cases for COVID-19 available at the Brazilian Ministry of Health's surveillance platform, was conducted. Variables such as, municipalities of residence, age, gender, signs and symptoms, comorbidities were included and associated with COVID-19 cases and outcomes. The spatial distribution was performed using the ArcGIS program. A total of 100,819 cases were evaluated. Overall, patients had the mean age of 42.3 years, were female (51.2%) and with lethality reaching 4.79% of cases. Main symptoms included fever (66.5%), cough (61.9%) and sore throat (39.8%). Regarding comorbidities, most of the patients presented cardiovascular disease (5.1%) and diabetes (4.2%). Neurological disease increased risk of death by nearly 15 times, followed by obesity (5.16 times) and immunodeficiency (5.09 time). The municipalities with the highest incidence rate were Parauapebas, Canaa dos Carajas and Jacareacanga. Similarity between the Lower Amazon, Marajo and Southwest mesoregions of Para state were observed concerning the highest morbidity rates. The obtained data demonstrated that the majority of cases occurred among young adults, females, with the classic influenza symptoms and chronic diseases.

114,34655550,"BACKGROUND: Evidence of whether people living with HIV are at elevated risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes is inconclusive. We aimed to investigate this association using the population-based National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) data in the USA. METHODS: We included all adult (aged >/=18 years) COVID-19 cases with any health-care encounter from 54 clinical sites in the USA, with data being deposited into the N3C. The outcomes were COVID-19 disease severity, hospitalisation, and mortality. Encounters in the same health-care system beginning on or after January 1, 2018, were also included to provide information about pre-existing health conditions (eg, comorbidities). Logistic regression models were employed to estimate the association of HIV infection and HIV markers (CD4 cell count, viral load) with hospitalisation, mortality, and clinical severity of COVID-19 (multinomial). The models were initially adjusted for demographic characteristics, then subsequently adjusted for smoking, obesity, and a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess moderation effects by demographic characteristics. FINDINGS: In the harmonised N3C data release set from Jan 1, 2020, to May 8, 2021, there were 1 436 622 adult COVID-19 cases, of these, 13 170 individuals had HIV infection. A total of 26 130 COVID-19 related deaths occurred, with 445 among people with HIV. After adjusting for all the covariates, people with HIV had higher odds of COVID-19 death (adjusted odds ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.16-1.44) and hospitalisation (1.20, 1.15-1.26), but lower odds of mild or moderate COVID-19 (0.61, 0.59-0.64) than people without HIV. Interaction terms revealed that the elevated odds were higher among older age groups, male, Black, African American, Hispanic, or Latinx adults. A lower CD4 cell count (<200 cells per muL) was associated with all the adverse COVID-19 outcomes, while viral suppression was only associated with reduced hospitalisation. INTERPRETATION: Given the COVID-19 pandemic's exacerbating effects on health inequities, public health and clinical communities must strengthen services and support to prevent aggravated COVID-19 outcomes among people with HIV, particularly for those with pronounced immunodeficiency.

115,34644316,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that a high body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for severe COVID-19. The aim of the present study was to assess whether a high BMI affects the risk of death or prolonged length of stay (LOS) in patients with COVID-19 during intensive care in Sweden. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this observational, register-based study, we included patients with COVID-19 from the Swedish Intensive Care Registry admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in Sweden. Outcomes assessed were death during intensive care and ICU LOS >/=14 days. We used logistic regression models to evaluate the association (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI]) between BMI and the outcomes. Valid weight and height information could be retrieved in 1,649 patients (1,227 (74.4%) males) with COVID-19. We found a significant association between BMI and the risk of the composite outcome death or LOS >/=14 days in survivors (OR per standard deviation [SD] increase 1.30, 95%CI 1.16-1.44, adjusted for sex, age and comorbidities), and this association remained after further adjustment for severity of illness (simplified acute physiology score; SAPS3) at ICU admission (OR 1.30 per SD, 95%CI 1.17-1.45). Individuals with a BMI >/= 35 kg/m2 had a doubled risk of the composite outcome. A high BMI was also associated with death during intensive care and a prolonged LOS in survivors assessed as separate outcomes. The main limitations were the restriction to the first wave of the pandemic, and the lack of information on socioeconomic status as well as smoking. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of Swedish ICU patients with COVID-19, a high BMI was associated with increasing risk of death and prolonged length of stay in the ICU. Based on our findings, we suggest that individuals with obesity should be more closely monitored when hospitalized for COVID-19.","BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that a high body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for severe COVID-19.

116,34642102,"BACKGROUND: Patients infected with novel COVID-19 virus have a spectrum of illnesses ranging from asymptomatic to death. Data have shown that age, sex, and obesity are strongly correlated with poor outcomes in COVID-19-positive patients. Bariatric surgery is the only treatment that provides significant, sustained weight loss in the severely obese. OBJECTIVES: Examine if prior bariatric surgery correlates with increased risk of hospitalization and outcome severity after COVID-19 infection. SETTING: University hospital METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective analysis of a COVID-19 database from a single, New York City-based, academic institution was conducted. A cohort of COVID-19-positive patients with a history of bariatric surgery (n = 124) were matched in a 1:4 ratio to a control cohort of COVID-19-positive patients who were eligible for bariatric surgery (BMI >/=40 kg/m(2) or BMI >35 kg/m(2) with a co-morbidity at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis) (n = 496). A comparison of outcomes, including mechanical ventilation requirements and deceased at discharge, was done between cohorts using chi(2) test or Fisher's exact test. Additionally, overall length of stay and duration of time in intensive care unit (ICU) were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Conditional logistic regression analyses were done to determine both unadjusted (UOR) and adjusted odds ratios (AOR). RESULTS: A total of 620 COVID-19-positive patients were included in this analysis. The categorization of bariatric surgeries included 36% Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB, n = 45), 36% laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB, n = 44), and 28% laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG, n = 35). The body mass index (BMI) for the bariatric group was 36.1 kg/m(2) (SD = 8.3), which was significantly lower than the control group, 41.4 kg/m(2) (SD = 6.5, P < .0001). There was also less burden of diabetes in the bariatric group (32%) compared with the control group (48%) (P = .0019). Patients with a history of bariatric surgery were less likely to be admitted through the emergency room (UOR = .39, P = .0001), less likely to require a ventilator during the admission (UOR=.42, P = .028), had a shorter length of stay in both the ICU (P = .033) and overall (UOR = .44, P = .0002), and were less likely to be deceased at discharge compared with the control group (OR = .42, P = .028). CONCLUSION: A history of bariatric surgery significantly decreases the risk of emergency room admission, mechanical ventilation, prolonged ICU stay, and death in patients with COVID-19. Even when adjusted for BMI and the co-morbidities associated with obesity, patients with a history of bariatric surgery still have a significant decrease in the risk of emergency room admission.","BACKGROUND: Patients infected with novel COVID-19 virus have a spectrum of illnesses ranging from asymptomatic to death.

Amongst many symptoms like myalgia, headache, cough, breathlessness; fatigue is is most prevalent and makes the patient severely debilitated. Research on PCS, in particular fatigue, in patients with diabetes has not been done. METHODOLOGY: In this prospective study, we included patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who had COVID-19 (mild to moderate severity), and matched T2D patients who did not suffer from COVID-19.

Symptoms were scored using Chalder Fatigue Scale (reported as fatigue score, FS) and handgrip strength (in kg) was recorded by Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were included (cases, 52, controls, 56). Both groups were matched for age, duration of diabetes, BMI, TSH, serum albumin and vitamin D levels. T2D patients who had COVID-19 showed significantly more fatigue when compared with patients who did not have COVID-19 but both groups had comparable handgrip strength. Furthermore, patients with T2D with previous COVID-19 infection and who had FS > 4 have had significant higher inflammation markers during acute illness, and post COVID-19, had increased post prandial blood glucose levels, lost more weight, had reduced physical activity and showed significantly lower handgrip strength as compared to those with FS < 4. CONCLUSION: Patients with T2D who had COVID-19 infection as compared to those without had significantly more fatigue after the acute illness, and those with higher FS had reduced handgrip strength indicating sarcopenia, even after careful matching for common contributory factors to fatigue at baseline. Rehabilitation of those with FS>4 after acute infection would require careful attention to nutrition, glycemic control and graduated physical activity protocol.","BACKGROUND: Post COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) has emerged as a major roadblock in the recovery of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

120,34625660,"Obesity is a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, with studies demonstrating the prevalence of individuals with obesity admitted with COVID-19 ranging between 30 and 60%. We determined whether early changes in microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with dysregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the specific functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7 the latter having cardioprotective and vasorelaxation effects. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of plasma samples for circulating miRNAs showed upregulation of miR-200c and miR-let-7b in otherwise healthy individuals with obesity. This was associated with significant downregulation of ACE2, a direct target for both miRNAs, in individuals with obesity. Correlation analysis confirmed a significant negative correlation between ACE2 and both the miRNAs. Studies showed that despite being the functional receptor, inhibition/downregulation of ACE2 did not reduce the severity of COVID-19 infection. In contrast, increased angiotensin II following inhibition of ACE2 may increase the severity of the disease. Taken together, our novel results identify that upregulation of miR-200c may increase the susceptibility of individuals with obesity to COVID-19. Considering miRNA are the earliest molecular regulators, the level of circulating miR-200c could be a potential biomarker in the early identification of those at the risk of severe COVID-19.","Obesity is a risk factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, with studies demonstrating the prevalence of individuals with obesity admitted with COVID-19 ranging between 30 and 60%.

The aim of this study was to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes in a cohort of patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 in Argentina. METHODS: Multicenter prospective cohort study of >/=18 years-old patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection consecutively admitted to 19 hospitals in Argentina. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify variables associated with 30-day mortality and admission to intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: A total of 809 patients were analyzed.

122,34618609,"BACKGROUND: The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used for the treatment of hypertension (HT). Whether the use of these drugs increases the infectivity of novel coronavirus and results in an additional risk for morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 is a matter of interest. OBJECTIVES: Assess the effect of ACEI/ARBs compared with other hypertensives on the clinical course and outcome in COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTINGS: Tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected data on adult inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia using ACEI/ARBs versus other antihypertensives between 15 March 2020, and 15 February 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Severity, clinical course, mortality, and time to PCR negativity between patients using ACEI/ARBs and other antihypertensives. SAMPLE SIZE: 435 RESULTS: ACEI/ARBs were used by 203 patients (46.6%) (median age: 71 [41-94] years), while 232 patients (53.4%) were using other antihypertensives (median age: 69 [22-93] years, P=.645 vs age of ACEI/ARB users). There were no statistically significant differences between the ACEI/ARBs users and non-users in the number of patients admitted to intensive care (65 cases [32%] vs. 74 cases [31.9%], P=.978), the median duration of stay in hospital (8 [1-54] days vs.7 [1-55] days, P=.806) the median duration of ICU stay (8 [1-40] days vs. 6 [1-25] days), and the mortality rate (48 cases [23.6%] vs. 61 [26.3%], P=.525). While the median days before transfer to the ICU was shorter in ACE/ARBI non-users (2 [1-15] days vs. 3 [1-21] days, P=.02), the difference was not important clinically. The median time to PCR negativity was similar in ACEI/ARBs users and non-users (13 [7-34] days for users and 13 [5-45] days for non-users), (P=.083). CONCLUSIONS: ACEI/ARB use is probably unrelated to poor prognosis in COVID-19 pneumonia inpatients. ACEI/ARBs did not prolong the time to PCR negativity. We conclude that using ACEI/ARBs probably does not increase the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. LIMITATIONS: Pharmacological therapies were not discussed in detail. The use of corticosteroids may affect the time to PCR negativity. We could not analyze the effect of obesity because of a lack of data.

123,34613896,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the clinical factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity in children and adolescents. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study across 45 US children's hospitals between April 2020 to September 2020 of pediatric patients discharged with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19. We assessed factors associated with hospitalization and factors associated with clinical severity (eg, admission to inpatient floor, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], admission to ICU with mechanical ventilation, shock, death) among those hospitalized. RESULTS: Among 19,976 COVID-19 encounters, 15,913 (79.7%) patients were discharged from the emergency department (ED) and 4063 (20.3%) were hospitalized. The clinical severity distribution among those hospitalized was moderate (3222, 79.3%), severe (431, 11.3%), and very severe (380, 9.4%). Factors associated with hospitalization vs discharge from the ED included private payor insurance (adjusted odds ratio [aOR],1.16; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3), obesity/type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) (aOR, 10.4; 95% CI, 8.9-13.3), asthma (aOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.6), cardiovascular disease, (aOR, 5.0; 95% CI, 4.3- 5.8), immunocompromised condition (aOR, 5.9; 95% CI, 5.0-6.7), pulmonary disease (aOR, 5.3; 95% CI, 3.4-8.2), and neurologic disease (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.7-5.8).

124,34593336,"BACKGROUND: Obesity independently increases the risk of hospitalization due to viral respiratory infections, including influenza virus and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. As an independent risk factor, obesity impairs the immune response to viral infections and decreases the effectiveness of immunizations. OBJECTIVES: Using influenza as a proxy, we aimed to determine the impact of bariatric surgery (BaS) on the risk of hospitalization due to viral respiratory infections. SETTING: Academic hospital, United States. METHODS: National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample data collected from 2010 to 2015 were examined. Patients were classified as treatment and control groups. Treatment subjects were defined as patients with a history of BaS and control subjects as patients with a body mass index >/=35 kg/m(2) and without a history of BaS. Any hospitalization with influenza as a primary diagnosis was identified. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression models were performed to assess the differences between groups. RESULTS: A total of 2,300,845 subjects were reviewed, of which 2,004,804 were control subjects and 296,041 were treated patients. Univariate analysis showed that the hospitalization rate in the treatment group was significantly lower than in the control group (.007% versus .019%, P < .0001), which was confirmed after adjusting for covariables (control versus treatment: odds ratio = 2.21, P = .0010). CONCLUSIONS: BaS may decrease the risk of hospitalization due to influenza, but further prospective studies are needed to confirm these results. We also suggest that these results should be translated into the development of similar studies to determine the impact of BaS on the incidence and severity of the coronavirus disease 2019.","BACKGROUND: Obesity independently increases the risk of hospitalization due to viral respiratory infections, including influenza virus and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

125,34584781,"Background Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a global problem. According to its definition, it is a disorder that occurs with some people who have undergone or witnessed a shocking, terrifying, or hazardous event, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with its consequent threats and fear meets the definition of a traumatic event. The main aim of this study is to determine PTSD in healthcare workers (HCWs) who survived COVID-19 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Subjects and methods Through an analytical cross-sectional study, HCWs working in Jeddah city with a minimum of seven days since their first positive COVID-19 result were included in this study. They were screened using the 'PTSD checklist for The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)' (PCL-5), which is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Results Out of all respondents (n=404), there was slight dominance of females (54.0%) over males (46.0%), and an almost equal distribution of Saudis (51.2%) and non-Saudis (48.8%); their mean age accounted for 36.9+/-8.7 years. PTSD was detected in 14.9%; the prevalence was significantly higher in those who had chronic diseases (23.7%), especially diabetics (30.8%) and obesity (41.2%), HCWs whose job necessitates exposure to positive cases (18.8%), and those who were isolated in hospitals while being ill. All the above values were statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion and recommendations The prevalence of PTSD in the HCWs who survived COVID-19 came within the range of that in HCWs who were dealing with cases of COVID-19 without being affected. Efforts should be made to alleviate stress in HCWs during their work in pandemics.","Background Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a global problem.

126,34581027,"BACKGROUND: Limited research has addressed the obesity-COVID-19 severity association in paediatric patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether obesity is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 severity in paediatric patients and whether age modifies this association. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients at NYU Langone Health from 1 March 2020 to 3 January 2021 aged 0-21 years with available anthropometric measurements: weight, length/height and/or body mass index (BMI). Modified log-Poisson models were utilized for the analysis. Main outcomes were 1) hospitalization and 2) critical illness (intensive care unit [ICU] admission). RESULTS: One hundred and fifteen of four hundred and ninety-four (23.3%) patients had obesity. Obesity was an independent risk factor for critical illness (adjusted risk ratio [ARR] 2.02, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.48). This association was modified by age, with obesity related to a greater risk for critical illness in adolescents (13-21 years) [ARR 3.09, 95% CI 1.48 to 6.47], but not in children (0-12 years). Obesity was not an independent risk factor for hospitalization for any age. CONCLUSION: Obesity was an independent risk factor for critical illness in paediatric patients, and this association was modified by age, with obesity related to a greater risk for critical illness in adolescents, but not in children. These findings are crucial for patient risk stratification and care.","BACKGROUND: Limited research has addressed the obesity-COVID-19 severity association in paediatric patients.

127,34580749,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, the causative virus of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), penetrates into the hosts' tissues via binding of its spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors after activation of the hosts' protease enzymes. The most prominent effect is observed when the virus binds to the ACE-2 receptors of the alveolar epithelium and endothelium. Testosterone exhibits an immunosuppressive effect, and androgens play a modulatory role on protease enzymes. It is known that various comorbidities, including obesity; pregnancy; diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2); hypertension; cancer; chronic kidney, liver, and lung diseases; cerebrovascular disease; heart conditions; human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunologic disease; and immune suppression; affect the severity of COVID-19 infection. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5-10% of reproductive aged-women. Hirsutism is observed in 70-80% of the patients, while increased testosterone levels are detected in more than 50% of the women with PCOS. This syndrome is also associated with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, increased renin-angiotensin system activity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome in a remarkable number of cases. PCOS also manifests a chronic pro-inflammatory state. Hyperandrogenism through hyperinsulinemia causes adipocyte hypertrophy and dysfunction that result in increased secretion of pro-inflammatory adipokine, which culminates in the creation of a chronic inflammatory state. In light of the metabolic and hormonal changes observed in women with PCOS, which make them more susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection, health care givers should provide special care and detailed counseling services.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2, the causative virus of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), penetrates into the hosts' tissues via binding of its spike protein to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors after activation of the hosts' protease enzymes.

128,34580250,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the general population, the risk of severe COVID-19 is associated with old age, male sex, hypertension, obesity and chronic diseases. Chronic lung diseases are listed as additional risk factors for hospitalization and ICU admission. The purpose of this review is to define whether chronic lung diseases, such as bronchiectasis and interstitial diseases, represent a risk for a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients affected by common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), the most common symptomatic primary antibody defect. RECENT FINDINGS: CVID patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic with a wide range of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic to mild/moderate and severe COVID-19. The meta-analysis of 88 CVID cases described in large cohorts and case reports demonstrated that CVID patients with chronic lung involvement have an increased risk for severe COVID-19 in comparison to CVID without lung diseases (50 vs. 28%, relative risk 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.04--2.92, P = 0.043). Differently from the general population, age and metabolic comorbidities did not represent a risk factor for severe course in this patient's population. SUMMARY: Underlying chronic lung diseases but not age represent a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in CVID. Prompt therapeutic intervention should be adopted in SARS-CoV-2 positive CVID patients with chronic lung diseases independently of their age.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the general population, the risk of severe COVID-19 is associated with old age, male sex, hypertension, obesity and chronic diseases.

130,34575910,"The susceptibility and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are associated with hyperandrogenism, obesity, and preexisting pulmonary, metabolic, renal, and cardiac conditions. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder in premenopausal women, is associated with obesity, hyperandrogenism, and cardiometabolic dysregulations. We analyzed cardiac, renal, circulatory, and urinary SARS-CoV-2 viral entry proteins (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, furin, cathepsin L, and ADAM17) and androgen receptor (AR) expression, in a peripubertal androgen exposure model of PCOS. Peripubertal female mice were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and low (LFD) or high (HFD) fat diet for 90 days. HFD exacerbated DHT-induced increase in body weight, fat mass, and cardiac and renal hypertrophy. In the heart, DHT upregulated AR protein in both LFD and HFD, ACE2 in HFD, and ADAM17 in LFD. In the kidney, AR protein expression was upregulated by both DHT and HFD. Moreover, ACE2 and ADAM17 were upregulated by DHT in both diets. Renal TMPRSS2, furin, and cathepsin L were upregulated by DHT and differentially modulated by the diet. DHT upregulated urinary ACE2 in both diets, while neither treatment modified serum ACE2. Renal AR mRNA expression positively correlated with Ace2, Tmprss2, furin, cathepsin L, and ADAM17. Our findings suggest that women with PCOS could be a population with a high risk of COVID-19-associated cardiac and renal complications.

131,34575333,"BACKGROUND: Derangement of liver blood tests (LBT) is frequent in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to evaluate (a) the prevalence of deranged LBT as well as their association with (b) clinical severity at admission and (c) 30-day outcomes among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Consecutive patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the regional referral center over the 12-month period were included. Clinical severity of COVID-19 at hospital admission and 30-day outcomes (need for intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death) were analyzed. RESULTS: Derangement of LBT occurred in 2854/3812 (74.9%) of patients, most frequently due to elevation of AST (61.6%), GGT (46.1%) and ALT (33.4%). Elevated AST, ALT, GGT and low albumin were associated with more severe disease at admission. However, in multivariate Cox regression analysis, when adjusted for age, sex, obesity and presence of chronic liver disease, only AST remained associated with the risk of dying (HR 1.5081 and 2.1315, for elevations 1-3 x ULN and >3 x ULN, respectively) independently of comorbidity burden and COVID-19 severity at admission. Patients with more severe liver injury more frequently experienced defined adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Deranged LBTs are common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and might be used as predictors of adverse clinical outcomes.","BACKGROUND: Derangement of liver blood tests (LBT) is frequent in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

However, in multivariate Cox regression analysis, when adjusted for age, sex, obesity and presence of chronic liver disease, only AST remained associated with the risk of dying (HR 1.5081 and 2.1315, for elevations 1-3 x ULN and >3 x ULN, respectively) independently of comorbidity burden and COVID-19 severity at admission.

COVID-19 susceptibility, severity and recovery have demonstrated high variability worldwide. Variances in the host genetic architecture may underlie the inter-individual and population-scale differences in COVID-19 presentation. We performed a genome-wide association analysis employing the genotyping data from AncestryDNA for COVID-19 patients of European descent and used asymptomatic subjects as the control group. We identified 621 genetic variants that were significantly distinct between asymptomatic and acutely symptomatic COVID-19 patients (multiple-testing corrected p-value < 0.001). These variants were found to be associated with pathways governing host immunity, such as interferon, interleukin and cytokine signalling, and known COVID-19 comorbidities, such as obesity and cholesterol metabolism. Further, our ancestry analysis revealed that the asymptomatic COVID-19 patients possess discernibly higher proportions of the Ancestral North Eurasian (ANE) and Eastern Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) ancestry, which was introduced to Europe through Bell Beaker culture (Yamnaya related) and lower fractions of Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG) ancestry, while severely symptomatic patients have higher fractions of WHG and lower ANE/EHG ancestral components, thereby delineating the likely ancestral differences between the two groups.","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic to symptomatic with mild or moderate presentation and severe disease.

133,34571275,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the demographics, clinical characteristics and severity of patients infected with nine different SARS-CoV-2 variants, during three phases of the COVID-19 epidemic in Marseille. METHODS: A single centre retrospective cohort study was conducted in 1760 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 of Nextstrain clades 20A, 20B, and 20C (first phase, February-May 2020), Pangolin lineages B.1.177 (we named Marseille-2) and B.1.160 (Marseille-4) variants (second phase, June-December 2020), and B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma) and A.27 (Marseille-501) variants (third phase, January 2021-today). Outcomes were the occurrence of clinical failures, including hospitalisation, transfer to the intensive-care unit, and death. RESULTS: During each phase, no major differences were observed with regards to age and gender distribution, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and clinical symptoms between variants circulating in a given phase. The B.1.177 and B.1.160 variants were associated with more severe outcomes. Infections occurring during the second phase were associated with a higher rate of death as compared to infections during the first and third phases. Patients in the second phase were more likely to be hospitalised than those in the third phase. Patients infected during the third phase were more frequently obese than others.

Reaching physical activity (PA) guideline goals contribute to protect against numerous immune and inflammatory disorders, in addition to multi-morbidities and mortality. Elevated levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, being non-obese, and regular PA improves immunological function, mitigating sustained low-grade systemic inflammation and age-related deterioration of the immune system, or immunosenescence. Regular PA and being non-obese also improve the antibody response to vaccination. In this review, we highlight potential physiological, cellular, and molecular mechanisms that are affected by regular PA, increase the host antiviral defense, and may determine the course and outcome of COVID-19.

Using published GWAS data for GERD (78 707 cases; 288 734 controls) and COVID-19 susceptibility (up to 32 494 cases; 1.5 million controls), we examined the genetic relationship between GERD and three COVID-19 outcomes: risk of developing severe COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalization and overall COVID-19 risk. We estimated the genetic correlation between GERD and COVID-19 outcomes followed by Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess genetic causality. Conditional analyses were conducted to examine whether known COVID-19 risk factors (obesity, smoking, type-II diabetes, coronary artery disease) can explain the relationship between GERD and COVID-19. We found small to moderate genetic correlations between GERD and COVID-19 outcomes (rg between 0.06 and 0.24). MR analyses revealed a OR of 1.15 (95% CI: 0.96-1.39) for severe COVID-19; 1.16 (1.01-1.34) for risk of COVID-19 hospitalization; 1.05 (0.97-1.13) for overall risk of COVID-19 per doubling of odds in developing GERD. The genetic correlation/associations between GERD and COVID-19 showed mild attenuation towards the null when obesity and smoking was adjusted for. Susceptibility for GERD and risk of COVID-19 hospitalization were genetically correlated, with MR findings supporting a potential causal role between the two.

139,34548406,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic increased the number of patients needing invasive mechanical ventilation, either through an endotracheal tube or through a tracheostomy. Tracheomalacia is a rare but potentially severe complication of mechanical ventilation, which can significantly complicate the weaning process. The aim of this study was to describe the strategies of airway management in mechanically ventilated patients with respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2, the incidence of severe tracheomalacia, and investigate the factors associated with its occurrence. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study was performed in an Italian teaching hospital. All adult subjects admitted to the ICU between February 24, 2020, and June 30, 2020, treated with invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure caused by SARS-CoV-2 were included. Clinical data were collected on the day of ICU admission, whereas information regarding airway management was collected daily. RESULTS: A total of 151 subjects were included in the study. On admission, ARDS severity was mild in 21%, moderate in 62%, and severe in 17% of the cases, with an overall mortality of 40%. A tracheostomy was performed in 73 (48%), open surgical technique in 54 (74%), and percutaneous Ciaglia technique in 19 (26%). Subjects who had a tracheostomy performed had, compared to the other subjects, a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and longer ICU and hospital stay. Tracheomalacia was diagnosed in 8 (5%). The factors associated with tracheomalacia were female sex, obesity, and tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS: In our population, approximately 50% of subjects with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 were tracheostomized.

140,34540855,"Introduction: Given the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the consequent global healthcare crisis, there is an urgent need to better understand risk factors for symptom deterioration and mortality among patients with COVID-19. This systematic review aimed to meet the need by determining the predictive value of chronic diseases for COVID-19 severity and mortality. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Complete to identify studies published between December 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Two hundred and seventeen observational studies from 26 countries involving 624,986 patients were included. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and performed a cumulative meta-analysis. Results: We found that among COVID-19 patients, hypertension was a very common condition and was associated with higher severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mortality. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the strongest predictor for COVID-19 severity, admission to ICU, and mortality, while asthma was associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality. Patients with obesity were at a higher risk of experiencing severe symptoms of COVID-19 rather than mortality. Patients with cerebrovascular disease, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, or cancer were more likely to become severe COVID-19 cases and had a greater probability of mortality. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with chronic diseases were more likely to experience severe symptoms and ICU admission and faced a higher risk of mortality. Aggressive strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic should target patients with chronic diseases as a priority.","Introduction: Given the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the consequent global healthcare crisis, there is an urgent need to better understand risk factors for symptom deterioration and mortality among patients with COVID-19.

141,34539631,"Cytokines, chemokines and growth factors present different expression profiles related to the prognosis of COVID-19. We analyzed clinical parameters and assessed the expression of these biomarkers in patients with different disease severity in a hospitalized Peruvian cohort to determine those associated with worse prognosis. We measured anti-spike IgG antibodies by ELISA and 30 cytokines by quantitative suspension array technology in 123 sera samples. We analyzed differences between patients with moderate, severe and fatal COVID-19 by logistic regression at baseline and in longitudinal samples. Significant differences were found among the clinical parameters: hemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine and D-dimer levels. Higher anti-spike IgG antibody concentrations were associated to fatal patient outcomes. At hospitalization, IL-10, IL-6, MIP-1alpha, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, IL-5, IL1RA, TNFalpha and IL-8 levels were already increased in fatal patients group. Meanwhile, multivariable analysis revealed that increased GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, and IL-8 values were associated with fatal outcomes. Moreover, longitudinal analysis identified IL-6 and MCP-1 as the main risk factors related to mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this Peruvian cohort we identified and validated biomarkers related to COVID-19 outcomes. Further studies are needed to identify novel criteria for stratification of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at hospital entry. Background: In the most severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, large numbers of innate and adaptive immune cells become activated and begin to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, establishing an exacerbated feedback loop of inflammation. Methods: A total of 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Hospital Nacional Guillermo Almenara Irigoyen in Lima, Peru were enrolled during August-October 2020. Of these, 21 had moderate disease, 24 severe diseases and 10 died. We measured 30 cytokines and chemokines by quantitative suspension array technology and anti-spike IgG antibodies using a commercial ELISA. We evaluated these parameters in peripheral blood every 2-5 days until patient discharge or death. Patient information and clinical parameters related were obtained from the respective clinical histories. Results: The frequency of obesity differed among the 3 groups, being most frequent in patients who died. There were also significant differences in clinical parameters: hemoglobin, segmented neutrophils, lymphocytes,C-reactive protein, creatinine and D-dimer levels. Greater anti-spike IgG antibody concentrations were associated to fatal outcomes. In univariate analyses, higher baseline concentrations of IL-6, MIP-1alpha, GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, IL-5, IL1RA, TNFalpha, IL-8 and IL-12p70 correlated with severity, while multivariable analysis showed that increased concentrations in 4 biomarkers (GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-15, IL-8) were associated with fatal outcomes. Longitudinal analysis showed IL-6 (hazard ratio [HR] 6.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-28.7) and MCP-1 (HR 4.61, 95%CI 1.1-19.1) to be related to mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Demographic, clinical, and mortality data were gathered. Severity of disease was evaluated using the SOFA score system. CRP levels were measured and chest CT scans were performed. RESULTS: Most of patients had multifocal and bilateral ground glass opacity (GGO) pattern in chest CT scan. There were significant correlations between SOFA score on admission with multifocal and bilateral GGO (P = .010 and P = .011, respectively). Significant relationships were observed between unilateral and bilateral GGO patterns with CRP (P = .049 and P = .046, respectively). There was significant relationship between GGO patterns with comorbidities including overweight/obesity, heart failure, cardiovascular diseases, and malignancy (P < .05). No significant relationships were observed between chest CT scan results with mortality (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Multifocal bilateral GGO was the most common pattern.

We report the safety and efficacy of baricitinib combined with remdesivir and dexamethasone in 45 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at a tertiary academic medical center. METHODS: Retrospective review of 45 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients received 7-day course of baricitinib, 5-day course of remdesivir and 10-day course of dexamethasone. Clinical status and biomarkers were obtained daily. Outcomes assessed include mortality, duration of hospitalization, presence of shock, need for supplemental oxygen, need for non-invasive ventilation, need for mechanical ventilation and development of thrombosis. RESULTS: Obesity and multiple medical comorbidities were associated with hospitalization in the setting of COVID-19. Treated patients demonstrated rapid declines of C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer with gradual improvement in hemoglobin, platelet counts and clinical status. Only 2 of 45 (4.4%) treated patients required mechanical ventilation after initiating treatment and there were six deaths (13.3%).Only 2 of 45 (4.4%) treated patients required mechanical ventilation after initiating treatment.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity are considered risk factors for COVID-19 poor prognosis. In parallel, COVID-19 severe patients exhibit dyslipidemia and alterations in neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) associated with disease severity and mortality. To investigate whether such alterations are caused by the infection or results from preexisting comorbidities, this work analyzed dyslipidemia and the hemogram profile of COVID-19 patients according to the severity and compared with patients without T2DM or obesity comorbidities. Dyslipidemia, with a marked decrease in HDL levels, and increased NLR accompanied the disease severity, even in non-T2DM and non-obese patients, indicating that COVID-19 causes the observed alterations. Because decreased hemoglobin is involved in COVID-19 severity, and hemoglobin concentration is associated with metabolic diseases, the erythrogram of patients was also evaluated. We verified a drop in hemoglobin and erythrocyte number in severe patients, independently of T2DM and obesity, which may explain in part the need for artificial ventilation in severe cases. Thus, the control of such parameters (especially HDL levels, NLR, and hemoglobin concentration) could be a good strategy to prevent COVID-19 complications and death.","Patients with COVID-19 can be asymptomatic or present mild to severe symptoms, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular complications and death.

The objective of this study is to examine and quantify the association between overcrowded and multigenerational households and COVID-19 in New York City (NYC). STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: We conducted a Bayesian ecological time series analysis at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level in NYC to assess whether ZCTAs with higher proportions of overcrowded (defined as the proportion of the estimated number of housing units with more than one occupant per room) and multigenerational households (defined as the estimated percentage of residences occupied by a grandparent and a grandchild less than 18 years of age) were independently associated with higher suspected COVID-19 case rates (from NYC Department of Health Syndromic Surveillance data for March 1 to 30, 2020). Our main measure was an adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of suspected COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population. Our final model controlled for ZCTA-level sociodemographic factors (median income, poverty status, White race, essential workers), the prevalence of clinical conditions related to COVID-19 severity (obesity, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, asthma, smoking status, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and spatial clustering. RESULTS: 39,923 suspected COVID-19 cases were presented to emergency departments across 173 ZCTAs in NYC. Adjusted COVID-19 case rates increased by 67% (IRR 1.67, 95% CI = 1.12, 2.52) in ZCTAs in quartile four (versus one) for percent overcrowdedness and increased by 77% (IRR 1.77, 95% CI = 1.11, 2.79) in quartile four (versus one) for percent living in multigenerational housing. Interaction between both exposures was not significant (betainteraction = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Overcrowdedness and multigenerational housing are independent risk factors for suspected COVID-19. In the early phase of the surge in COVID cases, social distancing measures that increase house-bound populations may inadvertently but temporarily increase SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk and COVID-19 disease in these populations.","OBJECTIVES: The role of overcrowded and multigenerational households as a risk factor for COVID-19 remains unmeasured.

Individuals with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 display higher levels of ACE2 in the lungs compared to those without comorbidities, and conditions such as cell stress, elevated glucose levels and hypoxia may also increase the expression of ACE2. Here, we showed that patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) have a higher expression of ACE2 in BE tissues compared to normal squamous esophagus, and that the lower pH associated with BE may drive this increase in expression. Human primary monocytes cultured in reduced pH displayed increased ACE2 expression and higher viral load upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also showed in two independent cohorts of 1,357 COVID-19 patients that previous use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with 2- to 3-fold higher risk of death compared to those not using the drugs.

150,34478452,"Epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with comorbid conditions including diabetes, chronic lung, inflammatory and vascular disease, are at higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Genome-wide association studies have identified several loci associated with increased susceptibility and severity for COVID-19. However, it is not clear whether these associations are genetically determined or not. We used a Phenome-Wide Association (PheWAS) approach to investigate the role of genetically determined COVID-19 susceptibility on disease related outcomes. PheWAS analyses were performed in order to identify traits and diseases related to COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, evaluated through a predictive COVID-19 risk score. We utilised phenotypic data in up to 400,000 individuals from the UK Biobank, including Hospital Episode Statistics and General Practice data. We identified a spectrum of associations between both genetically determined COVID-19 susceptibility and severity with a number of traits. COVID-19 risk was associated with increased risk for phlebitis and thrombophlebitis (OR = 1.11, p = 5.36e-08). We also identified significant signals between COVID-19 susceptibility with blood clots in the leg (OR = 1.1, p = 1.66e-16) and with increased risk for blood clots in the lung (OR = 1.12, p = 1.45 e-10).

151,34467518,"INTRODUCTION: Assessing the risk factors for and consequences of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy is essential to guide clinical care. Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy have been among hospitalized patients, which may have exaggerated risk estimates of severe outcomes because all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pregnant population were not included. The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors for and outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy independent of severity of infection in a universally tested population, and to identify risk factors for and outcomes after severe infection requiring hospital admission. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective population-based cohort study in Denmark using data from the Danish National Patient Register and Danish Microbiology Database and prospectively registered data from medical records. We included all pregnancies between March 1 and October 31, 2020 and compared women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during pregnancy to non-infected pregnant women. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were both identified prospectively and through register linkage to ensure that all cases were identified and that cases were pregnant during infection. Main outcome measures were pregnancy, delivery, maternal, and neonatal outcomes. Severe infection was defined as hospital admission due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. RESULTS: Among 82 682 pregnancies, 418 women had SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, corresponding to an incidence of 5.1 per 1000 pregnancies, 23 (5.5%) of which required hospital admission due to COVID-19. Risk factors for infection were asthma (odds ratio [OR] 2.19, 95% CI 1.41-3.41) and being foreign born (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.70-2.64). Risk factors for hospital admission due to COVID-19 included obesity (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.00-7.51), smoking (OR 4.69, 95% CI 1.58-13.90), infection after gestational age (GA) 22 weeks (GA 22-27 weeks: OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.16-12.29; GA 28-36 weeks: OR 4.76, 95% CI 1.60-14.12), and having asthma (OR 4.53, 95% CI 1.39-14.79). We found no difference in any obstetrical or neonatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Only 1 in 20 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy required admission to hospital due to COVID-19.

152,34454894,"INTRODUCTION: Although patients' clinical conditions have been shown to be associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity and outcome, their impact on hospital costs are not known. This economic evaluation of COVID-19 admissions aimed to assess direct and fixed hospital costs and describe their particularities in different clinical and demographic conditions and outcomes in the largest public hospital in Latin America, located in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where a whole institute was exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 patients in response to the pandemic. METHODS: This is a partial economic evaluation performed from the hospital s perspective and is a prospective, observational cohort study to assess hospitalization costs of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted between March 30 and June 30, 2020, to Hospital das Clinicas of the University of Sao Paulo Medical School (HCFMUSP) and followed until discharge, death, or external transfer. Micro- and macro-costing methodologies were used to describe and analyze the total cost associated with each patient's underlying medical conditions, itinerary and outcomes as well as the cost components of different hospital sectors. RESULTS: The average cost of the 3254 admissions (51.7% of which involved intensive care unit stays) was US$12,637.42. The overhead cost was its main component. Sex, age and underlying hypertension (US$14,746.77), diabetes (US$15,002.12), obesity (US$18,941.55), chronic renal failure (US$15,377.84), and rheumatic (US$17,764.61), hematologic (US$15,908.25) and neurologic (US$15,257.95) diseases were associated with higher costs. Age strata >69 years, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19, comorbidities, use of mechanical ventilation or dialysis, surgery and outcomes remained associated with higher costs.

154,34449455,"ABSTRACT: The current global health crisis due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has prompted the medical community to investigate the effects of underlying medical conditions, including sleep-disordered breathing, on inpatient care. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common form of sleep-disordered breathing that may complicate numerous acquired conditions, particularly in inpatient and critical care settings. Viral pneumonia is a major contributor to intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and often presents more severely in patients with underlying pulmonary disease, especially those with obesity and OSA. This review summarizes the most recent data regarding complications of both OSA and obesity and highlights their impact on clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients. Additionally, it will highlight pertinent evidence for the complications of OSA in an organ-systems approach. Finally, this review will also discuss impatient treatment approaches for OSA, particularly in relation to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","ABSTRACT: The current global health crisis due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has prompted the medical community to investigate the effects of underlying medical conditions, including sleep-disordered breathing, on inpatient care.

We sought to characterize the plasmatic levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in patients with severe COVID-19 and to investigate an association between plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels and clinical outcomes and mortality. MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels in plasma from patients with COVID-19 treated in the ICU (COVID-19 group) and Control patients were measured with the zymography. The study groups were matched for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, BMI, and obesity profile. MMP-2 levels were lower and MMP-9 levels were higher in a COVID-19 group (p < 0.0001) compared to Controls. MMP-9 levels in COVID-19 patients were not affected by comorbidity such as hypertension or obesity. MMP-2 levels were affected by hypertension (p < 0.05), but unaffected by obesity status. Notably, hypertensive COVID-19 patients had higher MMP-2 levels compared to the non-hypertensive COVID-19 group, albeit still lower than Controls (p < 0.05). No association between MMP-2 and MMP-9 plasmatic levels and corticosteroid treatment or acute kidney injury was found in COVID-19 patients. The survival analysis showed that COVID-19 mortality was associated with increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. Age, hypertension, BMI, and MMP-2 and MMP-9 were better predictors of mortality during hospitalization than SAPS3 and SOFA scores at hospital admission. In conclusion, a significant association between MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels and COVID-19 was found. Notably, MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels predicted the risk of in-hospital death suggesting possible pathophysiologic and prognostic roles.","Respiratory symptoms are one of COVID-19 manifestations, and the metalloproteinases (MMPs) have essential roles in the lung physiology.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds to ACE2 to initiate the process of replication. This enzyme is widely present in human organ tissues, such as the heart and lung. The pathophysiology of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection is complex and may be associated with several factors and conditions that are more severe in COVID-19 patients, such as age, male gender, and comorbidities, namely, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, obesity, and diabetes. Here we present a comprehensive review that aims to correlate the levels of expression of the ACE2 in patients with comorbidities and with a poor outcome in COVID-19 disease. Significantly higher levels of expression of ACE2 were observed in myocardial and lung tissues in heart failure and COPD patients, respectively. An age-dependent increase in SARS2-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory epithelium may be also responsible for the increased severity of COVID-19 lung disease in elderly people. Although the role of ACE2 is highlighted regarding the damage that can arise upon the SARS-CoV-2 invasion, there was no association observed between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and the severity of COVID-19.","Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been proved to be the main host cell receptor for the binding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.

158,34441928,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is perhaps the most worrisome pandemic in the 21st century, having entailed devastating consequences for the whole society during the last year. Different studies have displayed an existing association between pregnancy and COVID-19 severity due to the various physiological changes that occur during gestation. Recent data identified maternal country of origin as an important determinant of COVID-19 presentation in pregnant women. However, the explanation of this fact remains to be fully elucidated. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to analyze the possible relationship between Human Development Index (HDI) of maternal country of origin with the morbimortality of pregnant women and their newborns. Here, we conducted a multicentric, ambispective, observational case-control study (1:1 ratio) and compare with the HDI of each country (group 1-very high HDI, group 2-high HDI, group 3-medium HDI, and group 4-low HDI). In total, 1347 pregnant women with confirmed SARV-CoV-2 infection (cases) were enrolled, and each was paired with one control to give a total number of 2694 participants from 81 tertiary care centers. Among the women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, more cases were produced of perinatal mortality, overall maternal morbidity, COVID-19 maternal morbidity, C-sections, hypertensive maternal morbidity, and perinatal morbidity. Our results described an inverse association between HDI and maternofetal morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the countries with an HDI lower than 1 showed higher rates of patients with maternal COVID-19-related morbidity (6.0% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.001), a need for oxygen therapy (4.7% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001), and maternal ICU admission (2.6% vs. 1.0%, p = 0.007). Compared to other risk factors such as overweight, obesity, preexisting and obstetric comorbidities, HDI emerged as an independent risk factor explaining much of the increased maternal-perinatal morbidity and mortality detected in our group of cases. Further research is needed to establish to confirm the real impact of this factor and its components on pregnancy outcomes.","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is perhaps the most worrisome pandemic in the 21st century, having entailed devastating consequences for the whole society during the last year.

We sought to determine predictors of hypoxemia and related adverse outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the two largest hospitals in Jerusalem, Israel, from 9 March through 16 July 2020. Patients were categorized as those who developed reduced (<94%) vs. preserved (>/=94%) arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) within the first 48 h after arrival to the emergency department. Overall, 492 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with reduced SpO2 were significantly older, had more comorbidities, higher body surface area (BSA) and body mass index (BMI), lower lymphocyte counts, impaired renal function, and elevated liver enzymes, c-reactive protein (CRP), and D-dimer levels as compared to those with preserved SpO2. In the multivariable regression analysis, older age (odds ratio (OR) 1.02 per year, p < 0.001), higher BSA (OR 1.16 per 0.10 m(2), p = 0.003) or BMI (OR 1.05 per 1 kg/m(2), p = 0.011), lower lymphocyte counts (OR 1.72 per 1 x 10(3)/muL decrease, p = 0.002), and elevated CRP (1.11 per 1 mg/dL increase, p < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of low SpO2.

162,34416466,"AIMS: The Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a global pandemic requiring global responses. The objective of this paper is to identify the common factors of COVID-19 cases and deaths among the 50 most affected countries. METHODS: We performed Ordinary least squares among a wide range of socio-economic, environmental, climatic and health indicators to explain the number of cases and deaths. RESULTS: The findings are: (i) obesity is the only significant global denominator for the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths; (ii) the percentage of the population over the age of 65 and number of hospital beds per 1000 population inversely correlated to mortality from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity increases vulnerability to COVID-19 infections and mortality. Global awareness of obesity and social investment in health infrastructure are pre-requisite for a pandemic adaptive future.

163,34408638,"The outbreak of the novel and highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in hundreds of millions of infections and millions of deaths globally. Infected individuals that progress to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) experience upper and lower respiratory complications that range in severity and may lead to wide-spread inflammation and generalized hypoxia or hypoxemia that impacts multiple organ systems, including the central and peripheral nervous systems. Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, multiple reports continue to emerge that detail neurological symptoms, ranging from relatively mild (e.g., impaired taste and/or smell) to severe (e.g., stroke), suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may be neurotropic and/or contribute to nervous system injury through direct and/or indirect mechanisms. To gain insight into the types of neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their possible relationship with age, sex, COVID-19 severity, and comorbidities, we performed a systematic review of case reports and series published in 2020 - April 4, 2021 of infected patients with neurological manifestations. Meta-analyses were conducted using individual patient data from reports where these data could be extracted. Here, we report neurological injury occurs across the lifespan in the context of infection, with and without known comorbidities, and with all disease severities, including asymptomatic patients. Older individuals, however, are more susceptible to developing life-threatening COVID-19 and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), such as stroke. A mild but inverse correlation with age was seen with CNS inflammatory diseases, such as encephalitis, as well as taste and/or smell disorders. When reported, increased age was also associated with comorbid cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and lipid disorders, but not with obesity. Obesity did correlate with development of critical COVID-19. Discussion into potential pathophysiological mechanisms by which neurological symptoms arise and long-term consequences of infection to the nervous system is also provided.","The outbreak of the novel and highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in hundreds of millions of infections and millions of deaths globally.

165,34403821,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory biomarkers have been used to portend disease severity in nonpregnant individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, currently, limited data are available, and with mixed results, to elucidate which inflammatory biomarkers may be most associated with clinical phenotype in pregnant patients. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare laboratory findings among pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection by symptom status and disease severity. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively evaluated pregnant patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed through polymerase chain reaction testing, at an urban academic US hospital between March 2020 and October 2020, performed for reported symptoms or universal screening on admission. In our hospital, all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were recommended to have baseline laboratory testing, including leukocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts; aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase; high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; procalcitonin; lactate dehydrogenase; D-dimer; and ferritin. We performed multivariable logistic regression to evaluate peak laboratory abnormalities significantly associated with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity with gestational age at diagnosis, maternal age, and obesity as covariates. The sensitivity and specificity of laboratory abnormalities were calculated to identify symptomatic vs asymptomatic infection and severe to critical disease vs mild to moderate disease. RESULTS: We identified 175 pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, of whom 100 (57%) were symptomatic; 17 (17%) of those who were symptomatic had a severe to critical disease. Laboratory data were available for 128 patients, of whom 67 (52%) were symptomatic. Compared with asymptomatic individuals, symptomatic individuals were more likely to exhibit elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels after adjusting for gestational age (adjusted odds ratio, 5.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-22.52; sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 43%). In symptomatic individuals, transaminitis (adjusted odds ratio, 5.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-25.43), elevated procalcitonin levels (adjusted odds ratio, 16.60; 95% confidence interval, 2.61-105.46), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (adjusted odds ratio, 17.55; 95% confidence interval, 2.51-122.78) were independently associated with severe to critical disease rather than mild to moderate disease after adjusting for maternal age and obesity. For differentiating disease severity, sensitivity rates for transaminitis, procalcitonin elevation, and lactate dehydrogenase elevation were 47%, 87%, and 53%, respectively, whereas the specificity rates were 89%, 63%, and 90%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory biomarkers in pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited vast heterogeneity, poor discriminative ability, and thereby limited clinical utility. Larger registry studies should evaluate which inflammatory biomarkers may be most useful for risk stratification and prognostication of pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, taking into account the physiology of pregnancy.","BACKGROUND: Inflammatory biomarkers have been used to portend disease severity in nonpregnant individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, it is yet unclear whether sex hormones are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we analysed sex hormone levels (estradiol and testosterone) of male and female COVID-19 patients (n = 50) admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) in comparison to control non-COVID-19 patients at the ICU (n = 42), non-COVID-19 patients with the most prevalent comorbidity (coronary heart diseases) present within the COVID-19 cohort (n = 39) and healthy individuals (n = 50). We detected significantly elevated estradiol levels in critically ill male COVID-19 patients compared to all control cohorts. Testosterone levels were significantly reduced in critically ill male COVID-19 patients compared to control cohorts. No statistically significant differences in sex hormone levels were detected in critically ill female COVID-19 patients, albeit similar trends towards elevated estradiol levels were observed. Linear regression analysis revealed that among a broad range of cytokines and chemokines analysed, IFN-gamma levels are positively associated with estradiol levels in male and female COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, male COVID-19 patients with elevated estradiol levels were more likely to receive ECMO treatment. Thus, we herein identified that disturbance of sex hormone metabolism might present a hallmark in critically ill male COVID-19 patients.","Male sex was repeatedly identified as a risk factor for death and intensive care admission.

METHODS: Patients healed from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from February 2020 to May 2020 were considered for inclusion in this study, regardless of the severity of the disease during the acute phase. Eligible patients were consecutively contacted and a semistructured interview was administered between February and March 2021 by trained medical staff. RESULTS: Three hundred three patients were eligible and accepted to participate in the study and were enrolled. Of those surveyed, most patients (81%) reported at least 1 symptom, and the most prevalent symptoms were fatigue (52%), pain (48%), and sleep disorders (47%). Sensory alterations were present in 28% of surveyed patients, but in most of these cases (74% of those affected by sensory alterations or 20% of the overall sample) symptoms reported were either anosmia or dysgeusia. Higher prevalence was generally observed with increasing age, although the most relevant differences were observed when comparing young versus middle-aged adults. CONCLUSIONS: At 12 months after acute infection, COVID-19 survivors were still suffering from symptoms identified at shorter follow-up, and the most frequent symptoms included fatigue, pain, and sleep disorders. A more severe impairment in the acute phase did not seem to predict more severe complications.","BACKGROUND: As the coronavirus pandemic spreads, more and more people are infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

169,34384426,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 diabetic adults are at increased risk of severe forms irrespective of obesity. In patients with type-II diabetes, fat distribution is characterized by visceral and ectopic adipose tissues expansion, resulting in systemic inflammation, which may play a role in driving the COVID-19 cytokine storm. Our aim was to determine if cardiac adipose tissue, combined to interleukin-6 levels, could predict adverse short-term outcomes, death and ICU requirement, in COVID-19 diabetic patients during the 21 days after admission. METHODS: Eighty one consecutive patients with type-II diabetes admitted for COVID-19 were included. Interleukin-6 measurement and chest computed tomography with total cardiac adipose tissue index (CATi) measurement were performed at admission. The primary outcome was death during the 21 days following admission while intensive care requirement with or without early death (ICU-R) defined the secondary endpoint. Associations of CATi and IL-6 and threshold values to predict the primary and secondary endpoints were determined. RESULTS: Of the enrolled patients (median age 66 years [IQR: 59-74]), 73% male, median body mass index (BMI) 27 kg/m(2) [IQR: 24-31]) 20 patients had died from COVID-19, 20 required intensive care and 41 were in conventional care at day 21 after admission. Increased CATi and IL-6 levels were both significantly related to increased early mortality (respectively OR = 6.15, p = 0.002; OR = 18.2, p < 0.0001) and ICU-R (respectively OR = 3.27, p = 0.01; OR = 4.86, p = 0.002). These associations remained significant independently of age, sex, BMI as well as troponin-T level and pulmonary lesion extension in CT. We combined CATi and IL-6 levels as a multiplicative interaction score (CATi*IL-6). The cut-point for this score was >/= 6386 with a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.87 (AUC = 0.88) and an OR of 59.6 for early mortality (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac adipose tissue index and IL-6 determination at admission could help physicians to better identify diabetic patients with a potentially severe and lethal short term course irrespective of obesity. Diabetic patients with high CATi at admission, a fortiori associated with high IL-6 levels could be a relevant target population to promptly initiate anti-inflammatory therapies.","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 diabetic adults are at increased risk of severe forms irrespective of obesity.

The primary outcome was death during the 21 days following admission while intensive care requirement with or without early death (ICU-R) defined the secondary endpoint. Associations of CATi and IL-6 and threshold values to predict the primary and secondary endpoints were determined. RESULTS: Of the enrolled patients (median age 66 years [IQR: 59-74]), 73% male, median body mass index (BMI) 27 kg/m(2) [IQR: 24-31]) 20 patients had died from COVID-19, 20 required intensive care and 41 were in conventional care at day 21 after admission. Increased CATi and IL-6 levels were both significantly related to increased early mortality (respectively OR = 6.15, p = 0.002; OR = 18.2, p < 0.0001) and ICU-R (respectively OR = 3.27, p = 0.01; OR = 4.86, p = 0.002). These associations remained significant independently of age, sex, BMI as well as troponin-T level and pulmonary lesion extension in CT. We combined CATi and IL-6 levels as a multiplicative interaction score (CATi*IL-6). The cut-point for this score was >/= 6386 with a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.87 (AUC = 0.88) and an OR of 59.6 for early mortality (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac adipose tissue index and IL-6 determination at admission could help physicians to better identify diabetic patients with a potentially severe and lethal short term course irrespective of obesity. Diabetic patients with high CATi at admission, a fortiori associated with high IL-6 levels could be a relevant target population to promptly initiate anti-inflammatory therapies.",Phan F, C,Journal Article," BACKGROUND: COVID-19 diabetic adults are at<br>increased risk of severe forms irrespective of obesity.<br>In patients with type-II diabetes, fat<br>distribution is characterized by visceral and ectopic<br>adipose tissues expansion, resulting in systemic<br>inflammation, which may play a role in driving the COVID-19<br>cytokine storm.

170,34379281,"BACKGROUND: Age is a risk factor for COVID severity. Most studies performed in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV2 infection have shown an over-representation of older patients and consequently few have properly defined COVID-19 in younger patients who require hospital admission. The aim of the present study was to analyze the clinical characteristics and risk factors for the development of respiratory failure among young (18 to 50 years) hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective nationwide cohort study included hospitalized patients from 18 to 50 years old with confirmed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and July 2, 2020. All patient data were obtained from the SEMI-COVID Registry. Respiratory failure was defined as the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) </=200 mmHg or the need for mechanical ventilation and/or high-flow nasal cannula or the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome. RESULTS: During the recruitment period, 15,034 patients were included in the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, of whom 2327 (15.4%) were younger than 50 years. Respiratory failure developed in 343 (14.7%), while mortality occurred in 2.3%. Patients with respiratory failure showed a higher incidence of major adverse cardiac events (44 (13%) vs 14 (0.8%), p<0.001), venous thrombosis (23 (6.7%) vs 14 (0.8%), p<0.001), mortality (43 (12.5%) vs 7 (0.4%), p<0.001), and longer hospital stay (15 (9-24) vs 6 (4-9), p<0.001), than the remaining patients. In multivariate analysis, variables associated with the development of respiratory failure were obesity (odds ratio (OR), 2.42; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.71 to 3.43; p<0.0001), alcohol abuse (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.26 to 4.58; p=0.0076), sleep apnea syndrome (SAHS) (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.07 to 3.43; p=0.032), Charlson index >/=1 (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.52; p=0.0013), fever (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.22; p=0.0075), lymphocytes </=1100 cells/muL (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.37; p=0.0033), LDH >320 U/I (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.18 to 2.42; p=0.0039), AST >35 mg/dL (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.52; p=0.003), sodium <135 mmol/L (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.24 to 4.33; p=0.0079), and C-reactive protein >8 mg/dL (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.72 to 3.41; p<0.0001).

172,34373739,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) appears to have higher pathogenicity among patients with obesity. Obesity, termed as body mass index greater than 30 kg/m(2), has now been demonstrated to be important comorbidity for disease severity during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated with adverse events. Unraveling mechanisms behind this phenomenon can assist scientists, clinicians, and policymakers in responding appropriately to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we systemically delineated the potential mechanistic links between obesity and worsening COVID-19 from altered physiology, underlying diseases, metabolism, immunity, cytokine storm, and thrombosis. Problematic ventilation caused by obesity and preexisting medical disorders exacerbate organ dysfunction for patients with obesity. Chronic metabolic disorders, including dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, vitamin D deficiency, and polymorphisms of metabolism-related genes in obesity, probably aid SARS-CoV-2 intrusion and impair antiviral responses. Obesity-induced inadequate antiviral immunity (interferon, natural killer cells, invariant natural killer T cell, dendritic cell, T cells, B cell) at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to delayed viral elimination, increased viral load, and expedited viral mutation. Cytokine storm, with the defective antiviral immunity, probably contributes to tissue damage and pathological progression, resulting in severe symptoms and poor prognosis. The prothrombotic state, driven in large part by endothelial dysfunction, platelet hyperactivation, hypercoagulability, and impaired fibrinolysis in obesity, also increases the risk of severe COVID-19. These mechanisms in the susceptibility to severe condition also open the possibility for host-directed therapies in population with obesity. By bridging work done in these fields, researchers can gain a holistic view of the paths forward and therapeutic opportunities to break the vicious cycle of obesity and its devastating complications in the next emerging pandemic.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) appears to have higher pathogenicity among patients with obesity.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study based on registry data from Brazil's influenza surveillance system. SETTING: Public and private hospitals across Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible population included 21 942 inpatients aged >/=20 years with positive reverse transcription-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 until 9 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Severe COVID-19 outcomes were non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation use, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Multivariate analyses were conducted separately for adults (20-59 years) and elders (>/=60 years) to test the combined association of obesity (without and with DM and/or CVD) and degrees of obesity with each outcome. RESULTS: A sample of 8848 adults and 12 925 elders were included. Among adults, obesity with DM and/or CVD showed higher prevalence of invasive (prevalence ratio 3.76, 95% CI 2.82 to 5.01) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation use (2.06, 1.58 to 2.69), ICU admission (1.60, 1.40 to 1.83) and death (1.79, 1.45 to 2.21) compared with the group without obesity, DM and CVD. In elders, obesity alone (without DM and CVD) had the highest prevalence of ICU admission (1.40, 1.07 to 1.82) and death (1.67, 1.00 to 2.80). In both age groups, obesity alone and combined with DM and/or CVD showed higher prevalence in all outcomes than DM and/or CVD.

175,34367933,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has left a significant impact on the world's health, economic and political systems; as of November 20, 2020, more than 57 million people have been infected worldwide, with over 1.3 million deaths. While the global spotlight is currently focused on combating this pandemic through means ranging from finding a treatment among existing therapeutic agents to inventing a vaccine that can aid in halting the further loss of life. AIM: To collect all systematic reviews and meta-analyses published related to COVID-19 to better identify available evidence, highlight gaps in knowledge, and elucidate further meta-analyses and umbrella reviews that are yet to be performed. METHODS: We explored studies based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses with the key-terms, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS virus, coronavirus disease, COVID-19, and SARS coronavirus-2. The included studies were extracted from Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases. The publication timeframe of included studies ranged between January 01, 2020, to October 30, 2020. Studies that were published in languages other than English were not considered for this systematic review. The finalized full-text articles are freely accessible in the public domain. RESULTS: Searching Embase, Medline, and Cochrane databases resulted in 1906, 669, and 19 results, respectively, that comprised 2594 studies. 515 duplicates were subsequently removed, leaving 2079 studies. The inclusion criteria were systematic reviews or meta-analyses. 860 results were excluded for being a review article, scope review, rapid review, panel review, or guideline that produced a total of 1219 studies. After screening articles were categorized, the included articles were put into main groups of clinical presentation, epidemiology, screening and diagnosis, severity assessment, special populations, and treatment.

176,34365925,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, has constituted one of the most serious health challenges of the century, globally. The causative organism was initially named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) but has subsequently been renamed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic has so far infected several million and killed about a million people worldwide. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the leading causes of morbidity worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To examine the critical role diabetes plays in the pathogenesis and prognosis of COVID-19 and to assess the emerging therapies available to fight the pandemic. METHODS: Authors conducted a systematic review of literature to examine the role of diabetes as a comorbidity in the pathogenesis and prognosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: Both experimental and observational data from early 2020 suggested that most people with COVID-19 have comorbidities, the most dominant of which are diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Empirical evidence indicates that diabetic patients infected with the COVID-19 disease had the worst outcomes concerning morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: A combination of underlying chronic conditions such as hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases together with altered ACE receptor expression, immune dysregulation via cytokine storm, alveolar and endothelial dysfunction, increased systemic coagulation may put individuals with diabetes at risk for COVID-19 severity. More studies are needed to elucidate how glucose-lowering drugs may modulate the host immune response in diabetic individuals, especially following the administration of potential COVID-19 vaccines.","BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, has constituted one of the most serious health challenges of the century, globally.

177,34363345,"BACKGROUND: Weak muscle strength has been associated with a wide range of adverse health outcomes. Yet, whether individuals with weaker muscle strength are more at risk for hospitalization due to severe COVID-19 is still unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the independent association between muscle strength and COVID-19 hospitalization. METHODS: Data from adults 50 years of age or older were analysed using logistic models adjusted for several chronic conditions, body-mass index, age, and sex. Hand-grip strength was repeatedly measured between 2004 and 2017 using a handheld dynamometer. COVID-19 hospitalization during the lockdown was self-reported in summer 2020 and was used as an indicator of COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: The study was based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and included 3600 older adults (68.8 +/- 8.8 years, 2044 female), among whom 316 were tested positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (8.8%), and 83 (2.3%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. Results showed that higher grip strength was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalization [adjusted odds ratio (OR) per increase of 1 standard deviation in grip strength = 0.64, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.45-0.87, P = 0.015]. Results also showed that age (OR for a 10 -year period = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.32-2.20, P < 0.001) and obesity (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.00-3.69, P = 0.025) were associated with higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Sensitivity analyses using different measurements of grip strength as well as robustness analyses based on rare-events logistic regression and a different sample of participants (i.e. COVID-19 patients) were consistent with the main results.

179,34355196,"Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) populations suffer from disproportionately higher rates of chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, that arises from metabolic dysfunction and are often associated with obesity and inflammation. In addition, the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has further compounded the effect of health inequities observed in Indigenous populations, including NHPI communities. Reversible lifestyle habits, such as diet, may either be protective of or contribute to the increasing prevalence of health inequities in these populations via the immunoepigenetic-microbiome axis. This axis offers insight into the connection between diet, epigenetics, the microbiome composition, immune function, and response to viral infection. Epigenetic mechanisms that regulate inflammatory states associated with metabolic diseases, including diabetes, are impacted by diet. Furthermore, diet may modulate the gut microbiome by influencing microbial diversity and richness; dysbiosis of the microbiome is associated with chronic disease. A high fiber diet facilitates a favorable microbiome composition and in turn increases production of intermediate metabolites named short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that act on metabolic and immune pathways. In contrast, low fiber diets typically associated with a westernized lifestyle decreases the abundance of microbial derived SCFAs. This decreased abundance is characteristic of metabolic syndromes and activation of chronic inflammatory states, having larger implications in disease pathogenesis of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders that once thrived on healthy traditional diets may be more sensitive than non-indigenous peoples to the metabolic perturbation of westernized diets that impinge on the immunoepigenetic-gut microbiome axis. Recent studies conducted in the Maunakea lab at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa John A. Burns School of Medicine have helped elucidate the connections between diet, microbiome composition, metabolic syndrome, and epigenetic regulation of immune function to better understand disease pathogenesis.

181,34348879,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a chronic, low-grade inflammatory disease. This study aimed to investigate the impact of MetS on the risk and severity of COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated a nationwide cohort with COVID-19 including all patients who underwent the test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Korea. The COVID-19 group included 4070 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and the age- and sex-matched control group included 27,618 subjects with negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. The endpoints were SARS-CoV-2 positivity and the severity of COVID-19. The prevalence of MetS was 24.7% and 24.5% in the COVID-19 and control groups, respectively. The presence of MetS was not associated with the risk of developing COVID-19. Among the components of MetS, central obesity was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.28, P = 0.001). The presence of MetS was significantly associated with severe COVID-19 (aOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.78-2.00, P = 0.352). Among the individual components of MetS, prediabetes/diabetes mellitus was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 (aOR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.21-2.13, P = 0.001). The risk of severe COVID-19 linearly increased according to the number of metabolic components (P for trend = 0.005). CONCLUSION: In this nationwide cohort study, the individuals with MetS had a significant increase in the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. These patients, particularly those with central obesity and insulin resistance, deserve special attention amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a chronic, low-grade inflammatory disease.

The presence of MetS was significantly associated with severe COVID-19 (aOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.78-2.00, P = 0.352). Among the individual components of MetS, prediabetes/diabetes mellitus was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 (aOR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.21-2.13, P = 0.001). The risk of severe COVID-19 linearly increased according to the number of metabolic components (P for trend = 0.005).

182,34348687,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to global research to predict those who are at greatest risk of developing severe disease and mortality. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the associations between obesity and the severity of and mortality due to COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases for studies evaluating the associations of obesity with COVID-19. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random- or fixed-effects models. Meta-regression analyses were conducted to estimate regression coefficients. RESULTS: Forty-six studies involving 625,153 patients were included. Compared with nonobese patients, obese patients had a significantly increased risk of infection.

183,34336157,"The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection is harshly debated, with observational and experimental studies reporting contrasting results. To clarify the role of HCQ in Covid-19 patients, we carried out a retrospective observational study of 4,396 unselected patients hospitalized for Covid-19 in Italy (February-May 2020). Patients' characteristics were collected at entry, including age, sex, obesity, smoking status, blood parameters, history of diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and chronic pulmonary diseases, and medications in use. These were used to identify subtypes of patients with similar characteristics through hierarchical clustering based on Gower distance. Using multivariable Cox regressions, these clusters were then tested for association with mortality and modification of effect by treatment with HCQ. We identified two clusters, one of 3,913 younger patients with lower circulating inflammation levels and better renal function, and one of 483 generally older and more comorbid subjects, more prevalently men and smokers. The latter group was at increased death risk adjusted by HCQ (HR[CI95%] = 3.80[3.08-4.67]), while HCQ showed an independent inverse association (0.51[0.43-0.61]), as well as a significant influence of cluster *HCQ interaction (p < 0.001). This was driven by a differential association of HCQ with mortality between the high (0.89[0.65-1.22]) and the low risk cluster (0.46[0.39-0.54]). These effects survived adjustments for additional medications in use and were concordant with associations with disease severity and outcome. These findings suggest a particularly beneficial effect of HCQ within low risk Covid-19 patients and may contribute to clarifying the current controversy on HCQ efficacy in Covid-19 treatment.","The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection is harshly debated, with observational and experimental studies reporting contrasting results.

186,34331541,"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying the association between obesity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity remain unclear. After verifying that obesity was a correlate of severe COVID-19 in US Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries, we compared immunological and virological phenotypes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in both obese and nonobese participants. METHODS: COVID-19-infected MHS beneficiaries were enrolled, and anthropometric, clinical, and demographic data were collected. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 peak IgG humoral response and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction viral load in obese and nonobese patients, stratified by hospitalization, utilizing logistic regression models. RESULTS: Data from 511 COVID-19 patients were analyzed, among whom 24% were obese and 14% severely obese. Obesity was independently associated with hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-3.18) and need for oxygen therapy (aOR, 3.39; 95% CI, 1.61-7.11). In outpatients, severely obese had a log10 (1.89) higher nucleocapsid (N1) genome equivalents (GE)/reaction and log10 (2.62) higher N2 GE/reaction than nonobese (P = 0.03 and P < .001, respectively). We noted a correlation between body mass index and peak anti-spike protein IgG in inpatients and outpatients (coefficient = 5.48, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is a strong correlate of COVID-19 severity in MHS beneficiaries.

This study investigated demographic and clinical risk factors for severe disease and readmission among young adults 18-29 years old, who were diagnosed at a hospital encounter in Houston, Texas, USA. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A retrospective registry-based chart review was conducted investigating demographic and clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19 among patients aged 18-29 with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within a large metropolitan healthcare system in Houston, Texas, USA. In the cohort of 1,853 young adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection at a hospital encounter, including 226 pregnant women, 1,438 (78%) scored 0 on the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and 833 (45%) were obese (>/=30 kg/m2). Within 30 days of their diagnostic encounter, 316 (17%) patients were diagnosed with pneumonia, 148 (8%) received other severe disease diagnoses, and 268 (14%) returned to the hospital after being discharged home.

189,34314067,"Although the underlying disease is associated with a severe course in adults and laboratory abnormalities have been widely reported, there are not sufficient data on the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children with pre-existing comorbid conditions and on laboratory findings. We aimed to describe the independent risk factors for estimating the severity of the COVID-19 in children. All children between 1 month and 18 years old who were hospitalized during the period of March 11-December 31, 2020, resulting from COVID-19 were included in the study. Patients were categorized into mild (group 1) and moderate + severe/critically (group 2) severity based on the criteria. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory variables between the two groups were compared. A total of 292 children confirmed to have COVID-19 infection were included in the study. The most common associated diseases were obesity (5.1%) and asthma bronchiale (4.1%). We observed that disease progressed more severely in patients with underlying diseases, especially obesity and asthma bronchiale (for patients with obesity odds ratio [OR] 9.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.92-43.28, p = 0.005 and for patients with asthma bronchiale OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.04-16.80, p = 0.044). In group 2 patients, presence of lymphopenia and hypoalbuminemia, and also an elevation in serum levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and uric acid were detected and these results were statistically significant (p values; p < 0.001, p = 0.046, p = 0.006, p = 0.045, p < 0.001, respectively). The strongest predictor of moderate-severe COVID-19 infections in the children was uric acid, with an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% CI 1.14-2.13, p = 0.005) and lymphocytes with an odds ratio of 0.7 (95% CI 0.55-0.88, p = 0.003). Although children are less susceptible to COVID-19, the pre-existing comorbid condition can predispose to severe disease. In addition, lymphopenia and high uric acid are indicators that COVID-19 infection may progress more severely.","Although the underlying disease is associated with a severe course in adults and laboratory abnormalities have been widely reported, there are not sufficient data on the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children with pre-existing comorbid conditions and on laboratory findings.

190,34307358,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new emerging respiratory virus, caused evolving pneumonia outbreak around the world. In SARS-Cov-2 infected patients, diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity are two metabolic diseases associated with higher severity of SARS-CoV-2 related complications, characterized by acute lung injury requiring assisted ventilation as well as fibrosis development in surviving patients. Different factors are potentially responsible for this exacerbated response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In patients with DM, base-line increase in inflammation and oxidative stress represent preexisting risk factors for virus-induced damages. Such factors are also likely to be found in obese patients. In addition, it has been proposed that massive injury to the alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells, which express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), leads to the activation of their stromal niches represented by the Lipofibroblasts (LIF). LIF are instrumental in maintaining the self-renewal of AT2 stem cells. LIF have been proposed to transdifferentiate into Myofibroblast (MYF) following injury to AT2 cells, thereby contributing to fibrosis. We hypothesized that LIF's activity could be impacted by DM or obesity in an age- and gender-dependent manner, rendering them more prone to transition toward the profibrotic MYF status in the context of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Understanding the cumulative effects of DM and/or obesity in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the cellular level will be crucial for efficient therapeutic solutions.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new emerging respiratory virus, caused evolving pneumonia outbreak around the world.

This narrative review will examine the existing literature on the relationships between social isolation, loneliness, mental health, and weight as they relate to the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Individuals with obesity are at very high risk for worsening course of COVID-19, hospitalization, and death. This population may also be more significantly impacted by the dietary and physical activity consequences resulting from lockdown, social distancing, and isolation. The pandemic has led to significant lifestyle disruptions. However, early studies have largely relied upon cross-sectional studies or convenience samples.

193,34289876,"BACKGROUND: Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) often have comorbidities, especially obesity, that may constitute a risk factor for severe forms of COVID-19. We aimed to assess prevalence and medical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adults with PWS. From November 2020 to January 2021, we performed a detailed medical survey on 342 adults and 305 children with PWS followed in the French reference center. RESULTS: We obtained responses from 288 adults (84%) and 239 children (78%). From March 2020 to January 2021, 38 adults (13.2%) and 13 children (5.4%) with PWS had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mean age of adults was 34.1 +/- 11.9 years and mean body mass index was 40.6 +/- 12.7 kg/m(2); 82% had obesity and 37% had diabetes. Only 3 children (23%) had obesity and none had diabetes. Similar to the general population, the most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 were asthenia, fever, cough, headache and shortness of breath. All patients had a favorable outcome. CONCLUSION: PWS itself is not a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in children and adults. On the contrary, evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults with PWS seems more favorable than expected, given their comorbidities.","BACKGROUND: Patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) often have comorbidities, especially obesity, that may constitute a risk factor for severe forms of COVID-19.

SETTING: Tertiary healthcare teaching hospital in Guadalajara, Mexico. PARTICIPANTS: All patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalised from 25 March to 7 September 2020 were included. End of study: 7 November 2020. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient survival analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method and comparison of factors by the log-rank test. Mortality risk factors analysed by multivariate Cox's proportional-hazard model. RESULTS: One thousand ten patients included: 386 (38%) died, 618 (61%) alive at discharge and six (0.6%) remained hospitalised. There was predominance of men (63%) and high frequency of overweight-obesity (71%); hypertension (54%); diabetes (40%); and lung (9%), cardiovascular (8%) and kidney diseases (11%); all of them significantly more frequent in non-survivors. Overweight-obesity was not different between groups, but severity of disease (Manchester Triage System and quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) was significantly worse in non-survivors, who were also significantly older (65 vs 45 years, respectively) and had haematological, biochemical, coagulation and inflammatory biomarkers more altered than survivors. Mortality predictors were invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV; OR 3.31, p<0.0001), admission to intensive care unit (ICU; OR 2.18, p<0.0001), age (OR 1.02, p<0.0001), Manchester Triage System (urgent OR 1.44, p=0.02; immediate/very urgent OR 2.02, p=0.004), baseline C reactive protein (CRP; OR 1.002, p=0.009) and antecedent of kidney disease (OR 1.58, p=0.04) CONCLUSIONS: Mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in this emerging country centre seemed to be higher than in developed countries.

In contrast, n-3 fatty acids may attenuate PA's activation of the coronavirus pathogenesis pathway by inhibiting the activity of such mediators as IL1beta, CCL2, PTGS2, and BAX. Furthermore, PA may modulate the expression of ACE2, the main cell surface receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed over 2.7 million lives globally.

It was later discovered that obesity is a strong risk factor for severe disease as well. Possible mechanisms for the increased risk associated with metabolic disease include the increased prevalence of acute respiratory syndrome, immune cell dysfunction, and chronic inflammatory states associated with obesity and diabetes.

197,34255563,"Objective: The aim of this study is to describe the main clinical phenotypes, laboratory findings, and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients hospitalized at the High Specialty Medical Unit # 71 of the Mexican Social Security Institute. Methods: Prospective observational cohort study with a total of 105 patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection at the High Specialty Medical Unit # 71 (Torreon, Coahuila, Mexico), from May 15th to August 15th, 2020. The cases were confirmed to be COVID-19 positive through an RT-qPCR test. Clinical phenotypes and laboratory tests were evaluated to determine the degree of severity of the disease and the most frequent comorbidities. Results: The clinical characteristics of a total of 105 hospitalized patients (47 females and 58 males; median age being 52 years) with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses were studied. The severity of the disease was classified as moderate grade (62.7%), severe grade (21.5%), and critical grade (15.6%). Among the most frequent underlying pathologies coexisted overweight (n = 75, 78.12%), obesity (n = 21, 21.87%), diabetes (n = 10, 9.52%), and hypertension (n = 6, 5.71%), some of these patients present more than one pathology. This association was found with diabetes (odds ratio [OR]: 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-1.97; p = 0.021) and high levels of D-dimer (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.08; p = 0.001). Conclusion: In this retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 from a specialty hospital in the northeast region of Mexico, it was observed that clinical phenotypes and D-dimer elevation were compatible with an inflammatory state by degree of severity; it was found that the hospitalized patients with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes and elevated D-dimer levels were significantly associated with increased mortality from COVID-19.

This multicenter data set can support robust evidence-based development of predictive and diagnostic tools and inform clinical care and policy. Objectives: To evaluate COVID-19 severity and risk factors over time and assess the use of machine learning to predict clinical severity. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a retrospective cohort study of 1926526 US adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection (polymerase chain reaction >99% or antigen <1%) and adult patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection who served as controls from 34 medical centers nationwide between January 1, 2020, and December 7, 2020, patients were stratified using a World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and demographic characteristics. Differences between groups over time were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Random forest and XGBoost models were used to predict severe clinical course (death, discharge to hospice, invasive ventilatory support, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Main Outcomes and Measures: Patient demographic characteristics and COVID-19 severity using the World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and differences between groups over time using multivariable logistic regression. Results: The cohort included 174568 adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 44.4 [18.6] years; 53.2% female) and 1133848 adult controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [19.2] years; 57.1% female). Of the 174568 adults with SARS-CoV-2, 32472 (18.6%) were hospitalized, and 6565 (20.2%) of those had a severe clinical course (invasive ventilatory support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, death, or discharge to hospice). Of the hospitalized patients, mortality was 11.6% overall and decreased from 16.4% in March to April 2020 to 8.6% in September to October 2020 (P = .002 for monthly trend). Using 64 inputs available on the first hospital day, this study predicted a severe clinical course using random forest and XGBoost models (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.87 for both) that were stable over time. The factor most strongly associated with clinical severity was pH; this result was consistent across machine learning methods.

199,34247342,"PURPOSE: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is an emerging pandemic, with a disease course varying from asymptomatic infection to critical disease resulting to death. Recognition of prognostic factors is essential because of its growing prevalence and high clinical costs. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the global prevalence of obesity in COVID-19 patients and to investigate whether obesity is a risk factor for the COVID-19, COVID-19 severity, and its poor clinical outcomes including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality. METHODS: The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020203386). A systematic search of Scopus, Medline, and Web of Sciences was conducted from 31 December 2019 to 1 June 2020 to find pertinent studies. After selection, 54 studies from 10 different countries were included in the quantitative analyses. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the associations. RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity was 33% (95% CI 30.0%-35.0%) among patients with COVID-19. Obesity was significantly associated with susceptibility to COVID-19 (OR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.58-3.70; moderate certainty) and COVID-19 severity (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.48-1.76; low certainty). Furthermore, obesity was a significant risk factor for hospitalization (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.47-2.09; very low certainty), mechanical ventilation (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.70-2.94; low certainty), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.38-2.22; low certainty), and death (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.06-1.41; low certainty) in COVID-19 patients.

In this retrospective study, data was extracted for 39,539 patients from the de-identified Mount Sinai Health System COVID-19 database. We assessed the risk of mortality based on the presence of comorbidities and organ-specific sequelae in 7,032 CoV2 positive (+) patients. Prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities was high among SARS-CoV2+ individuals. Diabetes, obesity, coronary artery disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure all increased overall mortality risk, while asthma did not. Ethnicity modified the risk of mortality associated with these comorbidities. With regards to secondary complications in the setting of infection, individuals with acute kidney injury and acute myocardial injury showed an increase in mortality risk. Cerebral infarcts and acute venous thromboembolic events were not associated with increased risk of mortality. Biomarkers for cardiovascular injury, coagulation, and inflammation were compared between deceased and survived individuals. We found that cardiac and coagulation biomarkers were elevated and fell beyond normal range more often in deceased patients. Several, but not all, inflammatory markers evaluated were increased in deceased patients. In summary, we identified comorbidities and sequelae along with peripheral blood biomarkers that were associated with elevated clinical severity and poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Overall, these findings detail the granularity of previously reported factors which may impact susceptibility, clinical severity, and mortality during the course of COVID-19 disease.","With the continuing rise of SARS-CoV2 infection globally and the emergence of various waves in different countries, understanding characteristics of susceptibility to infection, clinical severity, and outcomes remain vital.

202,34225131,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 which causes COVID-19 disease results in severe morbidity and mortality especially in vulnerable groups. Pregnancy by virtue of its physiological and anatomical adaptations increases the risk of severe infections especially those of the respiratory tract. This single stranded RNA virus is transmitted by droplets as well as soiled fomites. There are various degrees of disease severity- asymptomatic, mild, moderate severe and critical. Most infections in pregnancy are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. For these women, the consequences on the mother or pregnancy are minimal unless they have additional risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiorespiratory disease, obesity or are of ethnic minority background. Most women with symptoms will present with fever, unproductive cough, sore throat, myalgia, nasal congestion, loss of smell and taste with associated leukocytosis and lymphopenia. Diagnosis is by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal flocked swabs or saliva and pathognomonic features of ground-glass appearance and pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray or CT scans. Management in pregnancy is same as that for non-pregnant women with COVID-19. It is not an indication for elective delivery but assisted delivery in the second stage for those with moderate, severe or critical disease may be required to shorten this stage. COVID-19 is not an indication for interrupting pregnancy or caesarean section but the latter may be performed to facilitate ventilation support or resuscitation in those with severe disease. Pain relief in labour should not be different but regional analgesia is preferred for operative deliveries. Postpartum thromboprophylaxis should be considered and breast feeding encouraged with appropriate precautions to minimize vertical transmission. Pregnant and lactating women should be encouraged to receive the mRNA based vaccines as there is no evidence of adverse outcomes with these.","The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 which causes COVID-19 disease results in severe morbidity and mortality especially in vulnerable groups.

203,34223443,"OBJECTIVE: To measure the association of race, ethnicity, comorbidities, and insurance status with need for hospitalization of symptomatic emergency department patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: This study is a cohort study of symptomatic patients presenting to a single emergency department (ED) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 7-August 9, 2020. We collected patient-level information regarding demographics, insurance status, comorbidities, level of care, and mortality using a structured chart review. We compared characteristics of patients categorized by (1) home discharge, (2) general hospital ward admission, and (3) intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death within 30 days of the index visit. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to report odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) between hospital admission versus ED discharge home and between ICU care versus general hospital ward admission. RESULTS: In total, 994 patients who presented to the ED with symptoms were included in the analysis with 551 (55.4%) patients discharged home, 314 (31.6%) patients admitted to the general hospital ward, and 129 (13.0%) admitted to the ICU or dying. Patients requiring admission were more likely to be Black or to have public insurance (Medicaid and/or Medicare). Patients who were admitted to the ICU or dying were more likely aged >/= 65 years or male. In multivariable logistic regression, old age, public insurance, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart failure, and hyperlipidemia were independent predictors of hospital admission. When comparing those who needed ICU care versus general hospital ward admission in univariate logistic regression, patients with Medicaid (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.6), Medicare (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.1-8.4), Medicaid and Medicare (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.4-7.7), history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.2), hypertension (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.7), and heart failure (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.7) were more likely to be admitted into the ICU or die; Black (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.4-2.9) and Hispanic/Latino (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.6-1.8) patients were less likely to be admitted into the ICU; however, the associations were not statistically significant. In multivariable logistic regression, old age, male sex, public insurance, and heart failure were independent predictors of ICU care/death. CONCLUSION: Comorbidities and public insurance are predictors of more severe illness for patients with SARS-CoV-2.

205,34220807,"Obesity is one of the foremost risk factors in coronavirus infection resulting in severe illness and mortality as the pandemic progresses. Obesity is a well-known predisposed chronic inflammatory condition. The dynamics of obesity and its impacts on immunity may change the disease severity of pneumonia, especially in acute respiratory distress syndrome, a primary cause of death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The adipocytes of adipose tissue secret leptin in proportion to individuals' body fat mass. An increase in circulating plasma leptin is a typical characteristic of obesity and correlates with a leptin-resistant state. Leptin is considered a pleiotropic molecule regulating appetite and immunity. In immunity, leptin functions as a cytokine and coordinates the host's innate and adaptive responses by promoting the Th1 type of immune response. Leptin induced the proliferation and functions of antigen-presenting cells, monocytes, and T helper cells, subsequently influencing the pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by these cells, such as TNF-alpha, IL-2, or IL-6. Leptin scarcity or resistance is linked with dysregulation of cytokine secretion leading to autoimmune disorders, inflammatory responses, and increased susceptibility towards infectious diseases. Therefore, leptin activity by leptin long-lasting super active antagonist's dysregulation in patients with obesity might contribute to high mortality rates in these patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review systematically discusses the interplay mechanism between leptin and inflammatory cytokines and their contribution to the fatal outcomes in COVID-19 patients with obesity.","Obesity is one of the foremost risk factors in coronavirus infection resulting in severe illness and mortality as the pandemic progresses.

206,34220706,"The relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus is complicated and bidirectional. On the one hand, diabetes mellitus is considered one of the most important risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. Several factors that are often present in diabetes mellitus are likely to contribute to this risk, such as older age, a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state, hyperglycemia and underlying comorbidities (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and obesity). On the other hand, a severe COVID-19 infection, and its treatment with steroids, can have a specific negative impact on diabetes itself, leading to worsening of hyperglycemia through increased insulin resistance and reduced beta-cell secretory function. Worsening hyperglycemia can, in turn, adversely affect the course of COVID-19.

207,34217985,"BACKGROUND: Grip strength is one of the main components for the physical functioning in sarcopenia and physical frailty. OBJECTIVES: To explore the role of grip strength measurement at admission for predicting disease severity in COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic data, smoking status, comorbidities, COVID-19 related symptoms, grip strength, laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings at admission were all noted. Using a Smedley hand dynamometer, the maximum grip strength value (kg) after three measurements on the dominant side was recorded. Low grip strength was defined as two standard deviations below the gender-specific peak mean value of the healthy young adults (<32 kg for males, <19 kg for females). Patients were categorized into three groups according to clinical and CT findings. Severe illness group had pneumonia with a respiratory rate >30/min, oxygen saturation </=90%, or extensive lung involvement in CT. Moderate illness group had pneumonia with CT score </=11. Mild illness group had normal CT findings. RESULTS: The study population included 312 patients (140 F, 172 M). The distribution of mild, moderate and severe disease groups were 36.9%, 51.0% and 12.2%, respectively. Cough, fever, dyspnea, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were most frequent, and C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, and neutrophil levels were highest in the severe group (all p<.05). Absolute grip strength values were lowest and the frequency of having low grip strength were highest in the severe group (both p<.01). Since we found that the significant differences were stemming from the severe group, we combined the mild and moderate group as non-severe, and compared severe vs. non-severe groups with binary logistic regression analyses. When age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, presence of comorbidities and low grip strength, and abnormal laboratory findings were taken into analyses; age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.054 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.020-1.089]), obesity (OR: 2.822 [95% CI: 1.143-6.966]), COPD (OR: 5.699 [95 %CI: 1.231-26.383]), CRP level (OR: 1.023 [95% CI: 1.010-1.036]) and low grip strength (OR: 3.047 [95% CI: 1.146-8.103]) were observed to be independent predictors for severe COVID-19 disease (all p<.05).

Articles using the terms obesity or overweight without indicating the BMI value in these patients were common, but this is not useful, as the anthropometric parameters, when not defined by this index, are confusing due to the classification being different in the West compared to among Asian and Korean criteria-based adults. We proposed a new term, called COVID obesity, to define the importance of this anthropometric parameter, among others, in relation with this pandemic.","On 11 March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The mean BMI value of severe COVID-19 patients ranged from 24.5 to 33.4 kg/m(2), versus <18.5 to 24.3 kg/m(2) for non-severe patients. Articles using the terms obesity or overweight without indicating the BMI value in these patients were common, but this is not useful, as the anthropometric parameters, when not defined by this index, are confusing due to the classification being different in the West compared to among Asian and Korean criteria-based adults. We proposed a new term, called COVID obesity, to define the importance of this anthropometric parameter, among others, in relation with this pandemic.",Ovalle DLP, C,Journal Article," On 11 March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019<br>(COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health<br>Organization (WHO).

210,34202578,"OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 severity. This multi-center randomized clinical trial aims to determine the effects of 5000 IU versus 1000 IU daily oral vitamin D3 supplementation in the recovery of symptoms and other clinical parameters among mild to moderate COVID-19 patients with sub-optimal vitamin D status. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A total of 69 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 positive adults who were hospitalized for mild to moderate COVID-19 disease were allocated to receive once daily for 2 weeks either 5000 IU oral vitamin D3 (n = 36, 21 males; 15 females) or 1000 IU oral vitamin D3 (standard control) (n = 33, 13 males; 20 females). Anthropometrics were measured and blood samples were taken pre- and post-supplementation. Fasting blood glucose, lipids, serum 25(OH)D, and inflammatory markers were measured. COVID-19 symptoms were noted on admission and monitored until full recovery. RESULTS: Vitamin D supplementation for 2 weeks caused a significant increase in serum 25(OH)D levels in the 5000 IU group only (adjusted p = 0.003). Within-group comparisons also showed a significant decrease in BMI and IL-6 levels overtime in both groups (p-values < 0.05) but was not clinically significant in between-group comparisons. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the 5000 IU group had a significantly shorter time to recovery (days) than the 1000 IU group in resolving cough, even after adjusting for age, sex, baseline BMI, and D-dimer (6.2 +/- 0.8 versus 9.1 +/- 0.8; p = 0.039), and ageusia (loss of taste) (11.4 +/- 1.0 versus 16.9 +/- 1.7; p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: A 5000 IU daily oral vitamin D3 supplementation for 2 weeks reduces the time to recovery for cough and gustatory sensory loss among patients with sub-optimal vitamin D status and mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. The use of 5000 IU vitamin D3 as an adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 patients with suboptimal vitamin D status, even for a short duration, is recommended.","OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 severity.

211,34197283,"INTRODUCTION: Severe COVID-19 illness in adults has been linked to underlying medical conditions. This study identified frequent underlying conditions and their attributable risk of severe COVID-19 illness. METHODS: We used data from more than 800 US hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR) to describe hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older with COVID-19 from March 2020 through March 2021. We used multivariable generalized linear models to estimate adjusted risk of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death associated with frequent conditions and total number of conditions. RESULTS: Among 4,899,447 hospitalized adults in PHD-SR, 540,667 (11.0%) were patients with COVID-19, of whom 94.9% had at least 1 underlying medical condition. Essential hypertension (50.4%), disorders of lipid metabolism (49.4%), and obesity (33.0%) were the most common. The strongest risk factors for death were obesity (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.27-1.33), anxiety and fear-related disorders (aRR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.25-1.31), and diabetes with complication (aRR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.24-1.28), as well as the total number of conditions, with aRRs of death ranging from 1.53 (95% CI, 1.41-1.67) for patients with 1 condition to 3.82 (95% CI, 3.45-4.23) for patients with more than 10 conditions (compared with patients with no conditions). CONCLUSION: Certain underlying conditions and the number of conditions were associated with severe COVID-19 illness. Hypertension and disorders of lipid metabolism were the most frequent, whereas obesity, diabetes with complication, and anxiety disorders were the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness.

212,34192577,"BACKGROUND: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the levels of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) antigen in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a poor outcome compared with those with a good outcome, and explored factors that may affect the difference in terms of vWF antigen between the two groups. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase and Scopus databases was undertaken from inception until 7 April 2021. The primary outcome was poor outcome, which is a composite of mortality and severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: Ten studies including a total of 996 patients were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. vWF antigen was higher in patients with poor outcomes [standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.84 [0.45-1.23], P<0.001; I(2)=87.3, P<0.001).

213,34191715,"Introduction: There are still debatable facts about estimating the risk and severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in liver transplant recipients, as well as assessing the impact of the immunosuppressive therapy on the clinical course and incidence of liver failure. Material and Methods: We present a prospective study of liver transplant recipients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection admitted for treatment to the department of First Clinic of Abdominal Surgery, Military Medical Academy, Sofia during 25.11.2020 04.01.2021. The diagnosis is confirmed by a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 infection from a naso-pharyngeal swab. COVID-19 severity is estimated as mild (oxygen saturation (SpO2) 94% on room air and no imaging findings of pneumonia), moderate (SpO2 94%, imaging suggestive of pneumonia), and severe (need for high flow oxygen supplementation). Results: Three liver transplant recipients with COVID-19 were admitted and treated in our department during 25.11.2020 04.01.2021. All of them were male, mean age of 51.33 years (47 - 59) and their liver transplantations were performed 13, 5, and 1.5 years before. In each of the three patients a different clinical form of the disease was registered mild (n=1), moderate (n=1), and severe (n=1). Only the patient with severe disease had comorbidities - hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The patients with mild and moderate disease received dual immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil while the one with severe disease - tacrolimus only. A dose reduction of tacrolimus was undertaken following serum level evaluation without changing the dose of the mycophenolate mofetil for those on dual therapy. The patient with severe disease died from respiratory failure leading to a case fatality rate of 33.3%. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and hospitalization where possible are essential for the prompt initiation of treatment, prevention of complications and development of severe forms of COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients, especially in patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. During the course of treatment there may be a dose reduction of the immunosuppressive therapy but not discontinuation, especially of the calcineurin inhibitor in mono- or dual-therapy regimens.","Introduction: There are still debatable facts about estimating the risk and severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in liver transplant recipients, as well as assessing the impact of the immunosuppressive therapy on the clinical course and incidence of liver failure.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a large, longitudinal, prospective, unmatched diagnosed and not-diagnosed observational study assessing the effect of COVID-19 during pregnancy on mothers and neonates. Two consecutive not-diagnosed women were concomitantly enrolled immediately after each diagnosed woman was identified, at any stage during pregnancy or delivery, and at the same level of care to minimize bias. Women and neonates were followed until hospital discharge using the standardized INTERGROWTH-21(st) protocols and electronic data management system. A total of 43 institutions in 18 countries contributed to the study sample. The independent association between the 2 entities was quantified with the risk factors known to be associated with preeclampsia analyzed in each group. The outcomes were compared among women with COVID-19 alone, preeclampsia alone, both conditions, and those without either of the 2 conditions. RESULTS: We enrolled 2184 pregnant women; of these, 725 (33.2%) were enrolled in the COVID-19 diagnosed and 1459 (66.8%) in the COVID-19 not-diagnosed groups. Of these women, 123 had preeclampsia of which 59 of 725 (8.1%) were in the COVID-19 diagnosed group and 64 of 1459 (4.4%) were in the not-diagnosed group (risk ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.61). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and conditions associated with both COVID-19 and preeclampsia, the risk ratio for preeclampsia remained significant among all women (risk ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.52) and nulliparous women specifically (risk ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-3.05). There was a trend but no statistical significance among parous women (risk ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-2.73). The risk ratio for preterm birth for all women diagnosed with COVID-19 and preeclampsia was 4.05 (95% confidence interval, 2.99-5.49) and 6.26 (95% confidence interval, 4.35-9.00) for nulliparous women. Compared with women with neither condition diagnosed, the composite adverse perinatal outcome showed a stepwise increase in the risk ratio for COVID-19 without preeclampsia, preeclampsia without COVID-19, and COVID-19 with preeclampsia (risk ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-2.86; risk ratio, 2.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-4.45; and risk ratio, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-4.82, respectively). Similar findings were found for the composite adverse maternal outcome with risk ratios of 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.35), 2.07 (95% confidence interval, 1.20-3.57), and 2.77 (95% confidence interval, 1.66-4.63). The association between COVID-19 and gestational hypertension and the direction of the effects on preterm birth and adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes, were similar to preeclampsia, but confined to nulliparous women with lower risk ratios. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 during pregnancy is strongly associated with preeclampsia, especially among nulliparous women. This association is independent of any risk factors and preexisting conditions. COVID-19 severity does not seem to be a factor in this association. Both conditions are associated independently of and in an additive fashion with preterm birth, severe perinatal morbidity and mortality, and adverse maternal outcomes. Women with preeclampsia should be considered a particularly vulnerable group with regard to the risks posed by COVID-19.","BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the suggested link between COVID-19 during pregnancy and preeclampsia is an independent association or if these are caused by common risk factors.

216,34182162,"COVID-19 has had a calamitous effect on the global community. Despite intense study, the immunologic response to the infection is only partially understood. In addition to older age and ethnicity, patients with comorbidities including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, malignancy, renal, and pulmonary disease may experience severe outcomes. Some patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) and secondary immunodeficiency also appear to be at increased risk from COVID-19. In addition to vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2, patients with PIDs often have chronic pulmonary disease and may not respond to vaccines, which exacerbates their long-term risk. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders, the most frequent symptomatic PID in adults and children, have a spectrum of B- and T-cell defects. It may be possible to stratify their risk for severe COVID-19 based on age, ethnicity, the severity of the T-cell defect, and the presence of other comorbidities. Patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders and other immunodeficiencies are at risk for Chronic COVID-19, a dangerous stalemate between a suboptimal immune response and SARS-CoV-2. Intra-host viral evolution could result in the rapid emergence of vaccine-resistant mutants and variants of high consequence; it is a public health emergency. Vaccination and prevention of Chronic COVID-19 in immunodeficient patients is therefore of the utmost priority. Having a reliable diagnostic assay for T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for evaluating responses to vaccines in these patients. New treatments for SARS-CoV-2 such as NZACE2-Patari are likely to be particularly beneficial for immunodeficient patients, especially those who fail to mount a robust T-cell response to COVID-19 vaccines.","COVID-19 has had a calamitous effect on the global community.

217,34181165,"BACKGROUND: Comorbidities increase the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization and mortality. As many comorbidities are common in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), we sought to investigate the effects of comorbidities in these patients on infection severity. AIM: To evaluate association between individual comorbidities and COVID-19 infection severity among patients with IBD. METHODS: Data were obtained from SECURE-IBD, an international registry created to evaluate COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD. We used multivariable regression to analyze associations between eleven non-IBD comorbidities and a composite primary outcome of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death. Comorbidities were first modeled individually, adjusting for potential confounders. Next, to determine the independent effect of comorbidities, we fit a model including all comorbidities as covariates. RESULTS: We analyzed 2,035 patients from 58 countries (mean age 42.7 years, 50.6% male). A total of 538 patients (26.4%) experienced severe COVID-19. All comorbidities but a history of stroke and obesity were associated with severe infection in our initial analysis, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.9 to 3.7. In a model including all comorbidities significantly associated with the composite outcome in the initial analysis, as well as other confounders, most comorbidities remained significant, with the highest risk in chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. CONCLUSION: Many non-IBD comorbidities are associated with a two to threefold increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization or death among patients with IBD. These data can be used to risk-stratify and guide treatment and lifestyle decisions during the ongoing pandemic.","BACKGROUND: Comorbidities increase the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization and mortality.

218,34168067,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the impact of obesity on disease severity and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among hospitalized children. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study from the Society of Critical Care Medicine Viral Respiratory Illness Universal Study registry included all children hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 2020 to January 2021. Obesity was defined by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention BMI or World Health Organization weight for length criteria. Critical illness definition was adapted from National Institutes of Health criteria of critical COVID. Multivariate mixed logistic and linear regression was performed to calculate the adjusted odds ratio of critical illness and the adjusted impact of obesity on hospital length of stay. RESULTS: Data from 795 patients (96.4% United States) from 45 sites were analyzed, including 251 (31.5%) with obesity and 544 (68.5%) without. A higher proportion of patients with obesity were adolescents, of Hispanic ethnicity, and had other comorbidities. Those with obesity were also more likely to be diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (35.7% vs 28.1%, P = .04) and had higher ICU admission rates (57% vs 44%, P < .01) with more critical illness (30.3% vs 18.3%, P < .01). Obesity had more impact on acute COVID-19 severity than on multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children presentation. The adjusted odds ratio for critical illness with obesity was 3.11 (95% confidence interval: 1.8-5.3). Patients with obesity had longer adjusted length of stay (exponentiated parameter estimate 1.3; 95% confidence interval: 1.1-1.5) compared with patients without obesity but did not have increased mortality risk due to COVID-19 (2.4% vs 1.5%, P = .38).

222,34160836,"OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor can harm testes function. The objectives were to analyse the prevalence of low serum testosterone (LT) and impaired fertility potential (Leydig and Sertoli cells dysfunction, respectively) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) male survivors and to evaluate acute infection-related associated factors. Also, we explore its association with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) and quality of life (QOL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male adults recovered from polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 were offered a structured evaluation 8-12 weeks after recovery. The main outcome measure(s) were as follows: LT, defined as total testosterone (TT) < 2 ng/ml or if TT levels 2-4 ng/ml as calculated free testosterone < 6.36 ng/dl; Sertoli cell dysfunction was defined as inhibin-B < 89 pg/ml. Secondary outcome-associated factors were analysed by multiple logistic regression (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval [CI]). QOL was evaluated by SF-36 v.2. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-three patients were evaluated at a median (interquartile range) of 77 days (72-83) after disease onset; 72% of them recovered from severe pneumonia. LT was detected in 41 patients (28.7%; 95% CI: 21.8-36.5). Low levels of inhibin-B were detected in 25 patients (18.1%; 95% CI: 12.5-25.3). After multivariate adjustment, obesity and hypokalaemia were associated with LT, whereas age more than 65 was an independent predictor of Sertoli cell dysfunction. LT or Sertoli cell dysfunction was not associated with PCS. Patients with LT had a lower score in four domains of QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of male LT and impaired fertility potential in COVID-19 survivors is high in the medium term. Traditional risk factors and severity markers for COVID-19 could be predictive.","OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor can harm testes function.

226,34151287,"IMPORTANCE: Prone positioning improves clinical outcomes in moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and has been widely adopted for the treatment of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019. Little is known about the effects of prone positioning among patients with less severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, obesity, or those treated with pulmonary vasodilators. OBJECTIVES: We characterize the change in oxygenation, respiratory system compliance, and dead-space-to-tidal-volume ratio in response to prone positioning in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome with a range of severities. A subset analysis of patients treated with inhaled nitric oxide and subsequent prone positioning explored the influence of pulmonary vasodilation on the physiology of prone positioning. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of all consecutively admitted adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019 treated with mechanical ventilation and prone positioning in the ICUs of an academic hospital between March 11, 2020, and May 1, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Respiratory system mechanics and gas exchange during the first episode of prone positioning. RESULTS: Among 122 patients, median (interquartile range) age was 60 years (51-71 yr), median body mass index was 31.5 kg/m(2) (27-35 kg/m(2)), and 50 patients (41%) were female. The ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 improved with prone positioning in 90% of patients. Prone positioning was associated with a significant increase in the ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 (from median 149 [123-170] to 226 [169-268], p < 0.001) but no change in dead-space-to-tidal-volume ratio or respiratory system compliance. Supine ratio of Pao2 to Fio2, respiratory system compliance, positive end-expiratory pressure, and body mass index did not correlate with absolute change in the ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 with prone positioning. However, patients with ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 less than 150 experienced a greater relative improvement in oxygenation with prone positioning than patients with ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 greater than or equal to 150 (median percent change in ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 62 [29-107] vs 30 [10-70], p = 0.002). Among 12 patients, inhaled nitric oxide prior to prone positioning was associated with a significant increase in the ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 (from median 136 [77-168] to 170 [138-213], p = 0.003) and decrease in dead-space-to-tidal-volume ratio (0.54 [0.49-0.58] to 0.46 [0.44-0.53], p = 0.001). Subsequent prone positioning in this subgroup further improved the ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 (from 145 [122-183] to 205 [150-232], p = 0.017) but did not change dead-space-to-tidal-volume ratio. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prone positioning improves oxygenation across the acute respiratory distress syndrome severity spectrum, irrespective of supine respiratory system compliance, positive end-expiratory pressure, or body mass index. There was a greater relative benefit among patients with more severe disease. Prone positioning confers an additive benefit in oxygenation among patients treated with inhaled nitric oxide.","IMPORTANCE: Prone positioning improves clinical outcomes in moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and has been widely adopted for the treatment of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019.

227,34147142,"BACKGROUND: The major complication of COVID-19 is hypoxaemic respiratory failure from capillary leak and alveolar oedema. Experimental and early clinical data suggest that the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor imatinib reverses pulmonary capillary leak. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial was done at 13 academic and non-academic teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Hospitalised patients (aged >/=18 years) with COVID-19, as confirmed by an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain a peripheral oxygen saturation of greater than 94% were eligible. Patients were excluded if they had severe pre-existing pulmonary disease, had pre-existing heart failure, had undergone active treatment of a haematological or non-haematological malignancy in the previous 12 months, had cytopenia, or were receiving concomitant treatment with medication known to strongly interact with imatinib. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral imatinib, given as a loading dose of 800 mg on day 0 followed by 400 mg daily on days 1-9, or placebo. Randomisation was done with a computer-based clinical data management platform with variable block sizes (containing two, four, or six patients), stratified by study site. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 consecutive hours, while being alive during a 28-day period. Secondary outcomes included safety, mortality at 28 days, and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. All efficacy and safety analyses were done in all randomised patients who had received at least one dose of study medication (modified intention-to-treat population). This study is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2020-001236-10). FINDINGS: Between March 31, 2020, and Jan 4, 2021, 805 patients were screened, of whom 400 were eligible and randomly assigned to the imatinib group (n=204) or the placebo group (n=196). A total of 385 (96%) patients (median age 64 years [IQR 56-73]) received at least one dose of study medication and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. Time to discontinuation of ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 h was not significantly different between the two groups (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.95 [95% CI 0.76-1.20]). At day 28, 15 (8%) of 197 patients had died in the imatinib group compared with 27 (14%) of 188 patients in the placebo group (unadjusted HR 0.51 [0.27-0.95]). After adjusting for baseline imbalances between the two groups (sex, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) the HR for mortality was 0.52 (95% CI 0.26-1.05). The HR for mechanical ventilation in the imatinib group compared with the placebo group was 1.07 (0.63-1.80; p=0.81). The median duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 7 days (IQR 3-13) in the imatinib group compared with 12 days (6-20) in the placebo group (p=0.0080). 91 (46%) of 197 patients in the imatinib group and 82 (44%) of 188 patients in the placebo group had at least one grade 3 or higher adverse event. The safety evaluation revealed no imatinib-associated adverse events. INTERPRETATION: The study failed to meet its primary outcome, as imatinib did not reduce the time to discontinuation of ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 consecutive hours in patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The observed effects on survival (although attenuated after adjustment for baseline imbalances) and duration of mechanical ventilation suggest that imatinib might confer clinical benefit in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, but further studies are required to validate these findings.

This study is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2020-001236-10). FINDINGS: Between March 31, 2020, and Jan 4, 2021, 805 patients were screened, of whom 400 were eligible and randomly assigned to the imatinib group (n=204) or the placebo group (n=196). A total of 385 (96%) patients (median age 64 years [IQR 56-73]) received at least one dose of study medication and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. Time to discontinuation of ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 h was not significantly different between the two groups (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.95 [95% CI 0.76-1.20]). At day 28, 15 (8%) of 197 patients had died in the imatinib group compared with 27 (14%) of 188 patients in the placebo group (unadjusted HR 0.51 [0.27-0.95]). After adjusting for baseline imbalances between the two groups (sex, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) the HR for mortality was 0.52 (95% CI 0.26-1.05). The HR for mechanical ventilation in the imatinib group compared with the placebo group was 1.07 (0.63-1.80; p=0.81). The median duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 7 days (IQR 3-13) in the imatinib group compared with 12 days (6-20) in the placebo group (p=0.0080). 91 (46%) of 197 patients in the imatinib group and 82 (44%) of 188 patients in the placebo group had at least one grade 3 or higher adverse event. The safety evaluation revealed no imatinib-associated adverse events. INTERPRETATION: The study failed to meet its primary outcome, as imatinib did not reduce the time to discontinuation of ventilation and supplemental oxygen for more than 48 consecutive hours in patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. The observed effects on survival (although attenuated after adjustment for baseline imbalances) and duration of mechanical ventilation suggest that imatinib might confer clinical benefit in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, but further studies are required to validate these findings.

228,34130961,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the risk factors contributing to severity on admission. Additionally, risk factors of worst severity and fatality were studied. Moreover, factors were compared based on three points: early severity, worst severity and fatality. DESIGN: An observational cohort study using data entered in a Japan nationwide COVID-19 inpatient registry, COVIREGI-JP. SETTING: As of 28 September 2020, 10480 cases from 802 facilities have been registered. Participating facilities cover a wide range of hospitals where patients with COVID-19 are admitted in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Participants who had a positive test result on any applicable SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests were admitted to participating healthcare facilities. A total of 3829 cases were identified from 16 January to 31 May 2020, of which 3376 cases were included in this study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was severe or nonsevere on admission, determined by the requirement of mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy, SpO2 or respiratory rate. Secondary outcome was the worst severity during hospitalisation, judged by the requirement of oxygen and/orinvasive mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: Risk factors for severity on admission were older age, men, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Cerebrovascular disease, liver disease, renal disease or dialysis, solid tumour and hyperlipidaemia did not influence severity on admission; however, it influenced worst severity. Fatality rates for obesity, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia were relatively lower. CONCLUSIONS: This study segregated the comorbidities influencing severity and death. It is possible that risk factors for severity on admission, worst severity and fatality are not consistent and may be propelled by different factors. Specifically, while hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and obesity had major effect on worst severity, their impact was mild on fatality in the Japanese population.

We aimed to assess if 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25OHD) levels are associated with interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels and with disease severity and mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively studied 103 in-patients admitted to a Northern-Italian hospital (age 66.1 +/- 14.1 years, 70 males) for severely-symptomatic COVID-19. Fifty-two subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection but mild COVID-19 symptoms (mildly-symptomatic COVID-19 patients) and 206 subjects without SARS-CoV-2 infection were controls. We measured 25OHD and IL-6 levels at admission and focused on respiratory outcome during hospitalization. RESULTS: Severely-symptomatic COVID-19 patients had lower 25OHD levels (18.2 +/- 11.4 ng/mL) than mildly-symptomatic COVID-19 patients and non-SARS-CoV-2-infected controls (30.3 +/- 8.5 ng/mL and 25.4 +/- 9.4 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). 25OHD and IL-6 levels were respectively lower and higher in severely-symptomatic COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care Unit [(ICU), 14.4 +/- 8.6 ng/mL and 43.0 (19.0-56.0) pg/mL, respectively], than in those not requiring ICU admission [22.4 +/- 1.4 ng/mL, p = 0.0001 and 16.0 (8.0-32.0) pg/mL, p = 0.0002, respectively].

230,34112355,"Since the discovery of manifest Zn deficiency in 1961, the increasing number of studies demonstrated the association between altered Zn status and multiple diseases. In this chapter, we provide a review of the most recent advances on the role of Zn in health and disease (2010-20), with a special focus on the role of Zn in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, diabetes and obesity, male and female reproduction, as well as COVID-19. In parallel with the revealed tight association between ASD risk and severity and Zn status, the particular mechanisms linking Zn(2+) and ASD pathogenesis like modulation of synaptic plasticity through ProSAP/Shank scaffold, neurotransmitter metabolism, and gut microbiota, have been elucidated. The increasing body of data indicate the potential involvement of Zn(2+) metabolism in neurodegeneration. Systemic Zn levels in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease were found to be reduced, whereas its sequestration in brain may result in modulation of amyloid beta and alpha-synuclein processing with subsequent toxic effects. Zn(2+) was shown to possess adipotropic effects through the role of zinc transporters, zinc finger proteins, and Zn-alpha2-glycoprotein in adipose tissue physiology, underlying its particular role in pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2. Recent findings also contribute to further understanding of the role of Zn2+ in spermatogenesis and sperm functioning, as well as oocyte development and fertilization. Finally, Zn(2+) was shown to be the potential adjuvant therapy in management of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19), underlining the perspectives of zinc in management of old and new threats.","Since the discovery of manifest Zn deficiency in 1961, the increasing number of studies demonstrated the association between altered Zn status and multiple diseases.

Considerable differences in disease severity and the mortality rate have been observed in different parts of the world. The present study investigated the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Iran. METHODS: We established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Iran. Epidemiological, imaging, laboratory, and clinical characteristics and outcomes were recorded from medical documents. The chi-square test, t-test, and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. A p<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: In total, 364 cases (207 males and 157 females) were analyzed. The most common symptoms were cough, fever, and dyspnea. Multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities with peripheral distribution were the predominant imaging finding. The mean age of patients was 54.28+/-18.81 years.

Objective: To examine the risk of severe COVID-19 illness among children associated with underlying medical conditions and medical complexity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included patients aged 18 years and younger with International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification code U07.1 (COVID-19) or B97.29 (other coronavirus) during an emergency department or inpatient encounter from March 2020 through January 2021. Data were collected from the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release, which included data from more than 800 US hospitals. Multivariable generalized linear models, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were used to estimate adjusted risk of severe COVID-19 illness associated with underlying medical conditions and medical complexity. Exposures: Underlying medical conditions and medical complexity (ie, presence of complex or noncomplex chronic disease). Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalization and severe illness when hospitalized (ie, combined outcome of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death). Results: Among 43465 patients with COVID-19 aged 18 years or younger, the median (interquartile range) age was 12 (4-16) years, 22943 (52.8%) were female patients, and 12491 (28.7%) had underlying medical conditions. The most common diagnosed conditions were asthma (4416 [10.2%]), neurodevelopmental disorders (1690 [3.9%]), anxiety and fear-related disorders (1374 [3.2%]), depressive disorders (1209 [2.8%]), and obesity (1071 [2.5%]). The strongest risk factors for hospitalization were type 1 diabetes (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 4.60; 95% CI, 3.91-5.42) and obesity (aRR, 3.07; 95% CI, 2.66-3.54), and the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness were type 1 diabetes (aRR, 2.38; 95% CI, 2.06-2.76) and cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies (aRR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.48-1.99). Prematurity was a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness among children younger than 2 years (aRR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.47-2.29). Chronic and complex chronic disease were risk factors for hospitalization, with aRRs of 2.91 (95% CI, 2.63-3.23) and 7.86 (95% CI, 6.91-8.95), respectively, as well as for severe COVID-19 illness, with aRRs of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.69-2.26) and 2.86 (95% CI, 2.47-3.32), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness among children with medical complexity and certain underlying conditions, such as type 1 diabetes, cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies, and obesity.

236,34086365,"Despite the ubiquity of the body mass index (BMI) in discourse on health, there is ambiguity in its use as a biomarker of current abnormality versus future risk. This distinction is consequential for knowledge of the relationship between body size and health, as well as for individuals deemed to have abnormal and 'unhealthy' bodies. Consequently, the purposes of this review are threefold. The first is to differentiate this 'biomarker' perspective from extant critiques of BMI as a proxy for health behaviours or as the defining characteristic of obesity as a disease. The second is to highlight the shift towards treating BMI as a measure of attained unhealthiness, rather than a probabilistic indicator of risk. Finally, rather than call for the abolition of BMI, this paper argues that its continued use as 'just a number' is in keeping with the push for weight neutrality in research and practice. The review concludes by demonstrating how the riskiness and unhealthiness of body size is conflated in public health messaging on COVID-19. BMI is a marker of risk, but its use as a surrogate for COVID-19 severity equates body size with health, shaping beliefs about vulnerability and personal responsibility amid an ongoing pandemic.","Despite the ubiquity of the body mass index (BMI) in discourse on health, there is ambiguity in its use as a biomarker of current abnormality versus future risk.

237,34079332,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put into evidence another pandemic - obesity. Currently, several studies have documented the association between obesity and COVID-19 severity. The mechanisms underlying the increased risk of complications and mortality in obese patients with COVID-19 are of diverse nature. Inflammation plays a central role in obesity. Metabolic alterations seen in obese patients are related to an inflammatory response, and several studies report elevated levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines in obese patients. Also, deregulated expression of adipokines, such as leptin and resistin, increase the expression of vascular adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 that contribute to increased vascular leukocyte adhesiveness and additional oxidative stress. Additionally, it is now recognized that the chronic impairment of systemic vascular endothelial function in patients with cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, including obesity, when intensified by the detrimental effects of SARS-CoV-2 over the endothelium, may explain their worse outcomes in COVID-19. In fact, vascular endothelial dysfunction may contribute to a unfavorable response of the endothelium to the infection by SARS-CoV-2, whereas alterations in cardiac structure and function and the prothrombotic environment in obesity may also provide a link to the increased cardiovascular events in these patients.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put into evidence another pandemic - obesity.

238,34066804,"The elderly and patients with several comorbidities experience more severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than healthy patients without underlying medical conditions. However, it is unclear why these people are prone to developing alveolar pneumonia, rapid exacerbations, and death. Therefore, we hypothesized that people with comorbidities may have a genetic predisposition that makes them more vulnerable to various factors; for example, they are likely to become more severely ill when infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To test this hypothesis, we searched the literature extensively. Polymorphisms of genes, such as those that encode angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1), have been associated with numerous comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obesity, and there are potential mechanisms to explain these associations (e.g., DD-type carriers have greater ACE1 activity, and patients with a genetic alpha-1 anti-trypsin (AAT) deficiency lack control over inflammatory mediators). Since comorbidities are associated with chronic inflammation and are closely related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), these individuals may already have a mild ACE1/ACE2 imbalance before viral infection, which increases their risk for developing severe cases of COVID-19. However, there is still much debate about the association between ACE1 D/I polymorphism and comorbidities. The best explanation for this discrepancy could be that the D allele and DD subtypes are associated with comorbidities, but the DD genotype alone does not have an exceptionally large effect. This is also expected since the ACE1 D/I polymorphism is only an intron marker. We also discuss how polymorphisms of AAT and other genes are involved in comorbidities and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Presumably, a combination of multiple genes and non-genetic factors is involved in the establishment of comorbidities and aggravation of COVID-19.","The elderly and patients with several comorbidities experience more severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than healthy patients without underlying medical conditions.

241,34046310,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) demonstrated that obesity is significantly associated with increased disease severity, clinical outcome, and mortality. The association between hepatic steatosis, which frequently accompanies obesity, and the pneumonia severity score (PSS) evaluated on computed tomography (CT), and the prevalence of steatosis in patients with COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. AIM: To assess the frequency of hepatic steatosis in the chest CT of COVID-19 patients and its association with the PSS. METHODS: The chest CT images of 485 patients who were admitted to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19 were retrospectively evaluated. The patients were divided into two groups as COVID-19-positive [CT- and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive] and controls (CT- and RT-PCR-negative). The CT images of both groups were evaluated for PSS as the ratio of the volume of involved lung parenchyma to the total lung volume. Hepatic steatosis was defined as a liver attenuation value of </= 40 Hounsfield units (HU). RESULTS: Of the 485 patients, 56.5% (n = 274) were defined as the COVID-19-positive group and 43.5% (n = 211) as the control group. The average age of the COVID-19-positive group was significantly higher than that of the control group (50.9 +/- 10.9 years vs 40.4 +/- 12.3 years, P < 0.001). The frequency of hepatic steatosis in the positive group was significantly higher compared with the control group (40.9% vs 19.4%, P < 0.001). The average hepatic attenuation values were significantly lower in the positive group compared with the control group (45.7 +/- 11.4 HU vs 53.9 +/- 15.9 HU, P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting for age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight, and obesity there was almost a 2.2 times greater odds of hepatic steatosis in the COVID-19-positive group than in the controls (odds ratio 2.187; 95% confidence interval: 1.336-3.580, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hepatic steatosis was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared with controls after adjustment for age and comorbidities.

High-dimensional flow cytometric characterization of immune cell subsets was performed at admission, 30 systemic cytokines/chemokines levels were sequentially measured, thirteen endothelial markers were determined at admission and at the zenith of the cytokines. Computed tomography scans on admission were quantified for lung damage and hepatic steatosis (n = 23). Abnormal BMI (> 25) observed in 72.6% of patients, was associated with a higher rate of intensive care unit hospitalization (p = 0.044). SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia, peripheral immune cell subsets and cytokines/chemokines were similar among BMI groups. A significant association between inflammatory cytokines and liver, renal, and endothelial dysfunctions was observed only in patients with obesity (BMI > 30). In contrast, early signs of lung damage (ground-glass opacity) correlated with Th1/M1/inflammatory cytokines only in normal weight patients. Later lesions of pulmonary consolidation correlated with BMI but were independent of cytokine levels. Our study reveals distinct physiopathological mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with obesity that may have important clinical implications.","To investigate the mechanisms underlying the SARS-CoV-2 infection severity observed in patients with obesity, we performed a prospective study of 51 patients evaluating the impact of multiple immune parameters during 2 weeks after admission, on vital organs' functions according to body mass index (BMI) categories.

243,34033365,"Since being declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization WHO), Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a devastating effect on global health and the world economy. The virus primarily affects the respiratory system and is spread from person to person via respiratory particles from coughing and sneezing. The majority of transmission occurs from close contact with presymptomatic, asymptomatic, or symptomatic carriers. The early course of the pandemic was characterized by the rapid spread of the virus that created an urgency to mitigate this new viral illness with experimental therapies and drug repurposing. Since then, due to an intense global research effort, significant progress has been made that has resulted in the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines at an unprecedented speed, leading to favorable patient outcomes. Currently, a variety of therapeutic options that include antiviral medications, monoclonal antibodies, and immunomodulatory agents are available in the management of COVID-19. However, the therapeutic potential and clinical use of these drugs are limited and specifically based on the stage of the illness. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 illness occurs in two distinct phases, an early stage characterized by profound SARS-CoV-2 viral replication followed by a late phase characterized by a hyperinflammatory state induced by the release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Interleukin (IL) 1, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and activation of the coagulation system resulting in a prothrombotic state. Antiviral therapy and antibody-based treatments are likely to be more effective if used during the early phase of the illness, and immunomodulating therapies either alone or in combination with antiviral and antibody-based therapies may be more effective when used in the later stage to combat the cytokine-mediated hyperinflammatory state that causes severe illness.[1] Individuals of all ages are at risk for infection and severe disease. However, individuals aged >/=65 years and with underlying medical comorbidities (obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, smoking, cancer, solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. The percentage of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization was six times higher in those with preexisting medical conditions than those without medical conditions (45.4% vs. 7.6%) based on an analysis by Stokes et al. of confirmed cases reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during January 22 to May 30, 2020.[2] A promising approach to address the COVID-19 associated mortality and prevent the increased utilization of healthcare resources is by terminating the progression of viral replication, thereby preventing the progression to the hyperinflammatory stage of COVID-19, which causes severe illness in high-risk nonhospitalized patients. Initially, the focus of treatment was directed mainly towards hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness. However, the clinical focus throughout the pandemic has expanded toward combatting the illness early on by reducing the viral load in patients with early disease, thus attempting to halt the disease progression. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 have yielded positive in vitro results.[3][4] They are considered a promising approach in managing nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of developing severe illness. This review discusses the mechanism of action of monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and current clinical indications of monoclonal antibody therapy for nonhospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness who are at high risk of developing severe illness. According to the US National Institutes for Health (NIH), management of nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 includes:[5]: Supportive/symptomatic care, reducing the risk of transmission, and advising patients when to seek in-person medical evaluation. Advising patients with dyspnea to seek in-person medical evaluation. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies are recommended for mild to moderate severity outpatients that are at high risk of progressing to severe disease. For patients discharged from the emergency department on supplemental oxygen, they recommend dexamethasone 6 mg once daily for the duration of oxygen supplementation, not to exceed ten days. For patients not on oxygen therapy, they recommend against the use of dexamethasone. They found insufficient evidence for or against the use of remdesivir in patients discharged from the emergency department on supplemental oxygen. Monoclonal Antibodies in COVID-19 Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are immune system proteins developed from a single cell lineage that demonstrate a high affinity for their target cell. Monoclonal antibodies were first developed by Kohler and Milstein in 1975 using hybridoma technology.[6] Since then, significant progress has been made in the molecular engineering world that has enabled the establishment of monoclonal antibodies as targeted therapies in various neoplastic conditions, autoimmune, post-transplant immunosuppression, and infectious diseases.[7] When used as antiviral therapies, neutralizing antibodies play an integral part in achieving passive antiviral immunity and are also instrumental in preventing or regulating many viral illnesses. Over the years, passive immunization against many viral diseases was achieved by administering polyclonal sera obtained from convalescent human donors or animals. However, polyclonal antibody preparations are increasingly being replaced by monoclonal antibodies by virtue of them, demonstrating a favorable safety profile and target specificity when used in different viral diseases.[8] Palivizumab was the first antiviral monoclonal antibody approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prophylaxis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in high-risk infants.[9] Over the years, significant developments in antibody engineering, improved understanding of the biology of viruses, and the direct and indirect effect of monoclonal antibodies on viral infections has resulted in the development of many novel monoclonal antibodies. Like other antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, when used as antiviral agents, are also susceptible to developing resistance as a result of alterations in the viral genome which can alter the pathogenic potential of the virus resulting in the emergence of viral escape mutants, which may render the virus-resistant to a specific monoclonal antibody. To counter this viral escape phenomenon, a combination of monoclonal antibodies, commonly referred to as antibody cocktails, have been proposed with the rationale that combining two specific monoclonal antibodies that complement each other can prevent neutralization escape by targeting multiple viral epitopes. There are an estimated 70 monoclonal antibodies currently in development or clinical trials to treat COVID-19. The FDA has granted four agents an emergency use authorization (EUA) for clinical use as combination antibody cocktails and one agent as monotherapy.","Since being declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization WHO), Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had a devastating effect on global health and the world economy.

245,34024518,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several factors that worsen the prognosis of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, such as obesity or diabetes. However, despite that nutrition may change in a lockdown situation, little is known about the influence of malnutrition among subjects hospitalized due to COVID-19. Our study aimed to assess whether the presence of malnutrition among patients admitted due to COVID-19 had any impact on clinical outcomes compared with patients with the same condition but well nourished. METHODS: 75 patients admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 were analyzed cross-sectionally. Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) was completed by phone interview. Clinical parameters included were extracted from the electronic medical record. RESULTS: According to the SGA, 27 admitted due to a COVID-19 infection had malnutrition. Patients not well nourished were older than patients with a SGA grade A (65 +/- 14.1 vs 49 +/- 15.1 years; p < 0.0001). Length of hospital stay among poorly nourished patients was significantly higher (18.4 +/- 15.6 vs 8.5 +/- 7.7 days; p = 0.001). Mortality rates and admission to ICU were greater among subjects with any degree of malnutrition compared with well-nourished patients (7.4% vs 0%; p = 0.05 and 44.4% vs 6.3%; p < 0.0001). CRP (120.9 +/- 106.2 vs 60.8 +/- 62.9 mg/l; p = 0.03), D-dimer (1516.9 +/- 1466.9 vs 461.1 +/- 353.7 ng/mL; p < 0.0001) and ferritin (847.8 +/- 741.1 vs 617.8 +/- 598.7mcg/l; p = 0.03) were higher in the group with malnutrition. Haemoglobin (11.6 +/- 2.1 vs 13.6 +/- 1.5 g/dl; p < 0.0001) and albumin 3.2 +/- 0.7 vs 4.1 +/- 0.5 g/dl; p < 0.0001) were lower in patients with any degree of malnutrition.

246,34024509,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Body mass index (BMI) has previously been shown to increase mortality and disease severity in patients with COVID-19, but the pooled effect estimate was heterogeneous. Although BMI is widely used as an indicator, it cannot distinguish visceral from subcutaneous fat. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between visceral adiposity, subcutaneous fat, and severe COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search using the databases: PubMed, Embase, and EuropePMC. Data on visceral fat area (VTA), subcutaneous fat area (SFA), and total fat area (TFA) were collected. The outcome of interest was severe COVID-19. We used a REML random-effects model to pool the mean differences and odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: There were 5 studies comprising of 539 patients. Patients with severe COVID-19 have a higher VTA (mean difference 41.7 cm(2) [27.0, 56.4], p < 0.001; I(2): 0%) and TFA (mean difference 64.6 cm(2) [26.2, 103.1], p = 0.001; I(2): 0%).

247,34024181,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate body mass index, multi-morbidity, and COVID-19 Risk Score as predictors of severe COVID-19 outcomes. PATIENTS: Patients from this study are from a well-characterized patient cohort collected at Mayo Clinic between January 1, 2020 and May 23, 2020; with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis defined as a positive result on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays from nasopharyngeal swab specimens. MEASURES: Demographic and clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record. The data included: date of birth, gender, ethnicity, race, marital status, medications (active COVID-19 agents), weight and height (from which the Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated, history of smoking, and comorbid conditions to calculate the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the U.S Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) multi-morbidity score. An additional COVID-19 Risk Score was also included. Outcomes included hospital admission, ICU admission, and death. RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the impact on mortality or hospital admission. Age, sex, and race (white/Latino, white/non-Latino, other, did not disclose) were adjusted for in the model. Patients with higher COVID-19 Risk Scores had a significantly higher likelihood of being at least admitted to the hospital (HR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.30, 2.50; P < .001), or experiencing death or inpatient admission (includes ICU admissions) (HR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.42; P = .028).

250,34013339,"BACKGROUND: Several inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared cytokines in COVID-19 versus influenza to define differentiating features of the inflammatory response to these pathogens and their association with severe disease. Because elevated body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for severe COVID-19, we examined the relationship of BMI to cytokines associated with severe disease. METHODS: Thirty-seven cytokines and chemokines were measured in plasma from 135 patients with COVID-19, 57 patients with influenza, and 30 healthy controls. Controlling for BMI, age, and sex, differences in cytokines between groups were determined by linear regression and random forest prediction was used to determine the cytokines most important in distinguishing severe COVID-19 and influenza. Mediation analysis was used to identify cytokines that mediate the effect of BMI and age on disease severity. RESULTS: Interleukin-18 (IL-18), IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were significantly increased in COVID-19 versus influenza patients, whereas granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), IFN-lambda1, IL-10, IL-15, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 were significantly elevated in the influenza group. In subgroup analysis based on disease severity, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were elevated in severe COVID-19, but not in severe influenza. Random forest analysis identified high IL-6 and low IFN-lambda1 levels as the most distinct between severe COVID-19 and severe influenza. Finally, IL-1RA was identified as a potential mediator of the effects of BMI on COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to activation of fundamentally different innate immune pathways in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and influenza infection, and emphasize drivers of severe COVID-19 to focus both mechanistic and therapeutic investigations.","BACKGROUND: Several inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

252,34007286,"OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spread rapidly all over the world, infecting all age groups with this novel virus. In this manuscript, we report characteristics of children with COVID-19 in Mazandaran province, northern Iran. METHOD: From 12 February to 28 July 2020, medical records of 100 children diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the hospitals of Mazandaran province were collected. Patients' age, gender, clinical symptoms, and signs, in addition to therapeutic management and outcomes, were reported. RESULTS: 57 (57%) boys and 43 girls with the mean age of 104.63 +/- 79.14 months were evaluated. 20 patients (20%) were transferred to the PICU (pediatric intensive care unit), and 13 children experienced a severe form of the disease, pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS). The mean duration of hospitalization was 5.3 +/- 4.7 days. Fever (81%), respiratory (79%), gastrointestinal (47%), and neurologic complaints (29%) were experienced by the patients in addition to skin rash (14%). Sixty-two patients needed supplemental oxygen, and 6 of them underwent endotracheal intubation. Leukopenia was reported in 7, anemia in 24, and thrombocytopenia in 12 patients. 4 patients with underlying diseases including chronic renal failure, Down syndrome with cerebral palsy, and morbid obesity died. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can cause symptoms in children in two stages. In the first week, upper and lower respiratory symptoms can occur which has lower severity and prevalence compared to adults. But after 2-3 weeks following infection, symptoms of MIS-C or multisystem involvement can occur and COVID-19 should be considered. The most common indication for admission is fever, rash, and respiratory problems.","OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spread rapidly all over the world, infecting all age groups with this novel virus.

Eligible studies were conducted in high-income countries and used multivariate analyses. PARTICIPANTS: After piloting, screening, data extraction and quality appraisal were performed by a single experienced reviewer. Of 3740 unique records identified, 34 were included that reported on median 596 (range 44-418 794) participants, aged 42-84 years. 19/34 (56%) were good quality. OUTCOMES: Hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, length of stay in hospital or intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, severe disease, mortality. RESULTS: Authors synthesised findings narratively and appraised the certainty of the evidence for each risk factor-outcome association. There was low or moderate certainty evidence for a large (>/=2-fold) magnitude of association between hospitalisation in people with COVID-19, and: obesity class III, heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, dementia, age >45 years, male gender, black race/ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic white), homelessness and low income. Age >60 and >70 years may be associated with large increases in mechanical ventilation and severe disease, respectively. For mortality, a large magnitude of association may exist with liver disease, Bangladeshi ethnicity (vs British white), age >45 years, age >80 years (vs 65-69 years) and male gender among 20-64 years (but not older).

We aim to identify risk factors specific to each state of COVID-19 progression from SARS-CoV-2 infection through death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 648,202 participants from the Veteran Affairs Million Veteran Program (2011-). We identified characteristics and 1,809 ICD code-based phenotypes from the electronic health record. We used logistic regression to examine the association of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), race, and prevalent phenotypes to the stages of COVID-19 disease progression: infection, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 30-day mortality (separate models for each). Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, number of visit months and ICD codes, state infection rate and controlled for multiple testing using false discovery rate (</=0.1). As of August 10, 2020, 5,929 individuals were SARS-CoV-2 positive and among those, 1,463 (25%) were hospitalized, 579 (10%) were in ICU, and 398 (7%) died. We observed a lower risk in women vs. men for ICU and mortality (Odds Ratio (95% CI): 0.48 (0.30-0.76) and 0.59 (0.31-1.15), respectively) and a higher risk in Black vs. Other race patients for hospitalization and ICU (OR (95%CI): 1.53 (1.32-1.77) and 1.63 (1.32-2.02), respectively). We observed an increased risk of all COVID-19 disease states with older age and BMI >/=35 vs. 20-24 kg/m2. Renal failure, respiratory failure, morbid obesity, acid-base balance disorder, white blood cell diseases, hydronephrosis and bacterial infections were associated with an increased risk of ICU admissions; sepsis, chronic skin ulcers, acid-base balance disorder and acidosis were associated with mortality.

258,33982105,"BACKGROUND: Many nutrients have powerful immunomodulatory actions with the potential to alter susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, progression to symptoms, likelihood of severe disease, and survival. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to review the latest evidence on how malnutrition across all its forms (under- and overnutrition and micronutrient status) may influence both susceptibility to, and progression of, COVID-19. METHODS: We synthesized information on 13 nutrition-related components and their potential interactions with COVID-19: overweight, obesity, and diabetes; protein-energy malnutrition; anemia; vitamins A, C, D, and E; PUFAs; iron; selenium; zinc; antioxidants; and nutritional support. For each section we provide: 1) a landscape review of pertinent material; 2) a systematic search of the literature in PubMed and EMBASE databases, including a wide range of preprint servers; and 3) a screen of 6 clinical trial registries. All original research was considered, without restriction to study design, and included if it covered: 1) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), or SARS-CoV viruses and 2) disease susceptibility or 3) disease progression, and 4) the nutritional component of interest. Searches took place between 16 May and 11 August 2020. RESULTS: Across the 13 searches, 2732 articles from PubMed and EMBASE, 4164 articles from the preprint servers, and 433 trials were returned. In the final narrative synthesis, we include 22 published articles, 38 preprint articles, and 79 trials. CONCLUSIONS: Currently there is limited evidence that high-dose supplements of micronutrients will either prevent severe disease or speed up recovery. However, results of clinical trials are eagerly awaited. Given the known impacts of all forms of malnutrition on the immune system, public health strategies to reduce micronutrient deficiencies and undernutrition remain of critical importance.

259,33980671,"In much of the developing world, severe malnutrition is the most prevalent cause of immunodeficiency and affects up to 50% of the population in some impoverished communities. As yet, we do not know how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will behave in populations with immunodeficiency caused by malnourishment. Interestingly, researchers are now speculating that, in some instances, a defective cellular immune system could paradoxically be a protective factor against severe disease in certain patients contracting SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. This could be linked to the absence of T-cell activation. Based on available information presented here, it is plausible that the hyperimmune response, and subsequent cytokine storm often associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), could be ""counteracted"" by the defective immune response seen in individuals with malnutrition-induced leptin deficiency.

260,33980231,"BACKGROUND: In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the hypothesis that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) increased the risk and/or severity of the disease was widely spread. Consequently, in many hospitals, these drugs were discontinued as a ""precautionary measure"". We aimed to assess whether the in-hospital discontinuation of ARBs or ACEIs, in real-life conditions, was associated with a reduced risk of death as compared to their continuation and also to compare head-to-head the continuation of ARBs with the continuation of ACEIs. METHODS: Adult patients with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission during March 2020 were consecutively selected from 7 hospitals in Madrid, Spain. Among them, we identified outpatient users of ACEIs/ARBs and divided them in two cohorts depending on treatment discontinuation/continuation at admission. Then, they were followed-up until discharge or in-hospital death. An intention-to-treat survival analysis was carried out and hazard ratios (HRs), and their 95%CIs were computed through a Cox regression model adjusted for propensity scores of discontinuation and controlled by potential mediators. RESULTS: Out of 625 ACEI/ARB users, 340 (54.4%) discontinued treatment. The in-hospital mortality rates were 27.6% and 27.7% in discontinuation and continuation cohorts, respectively (HR=1.01; 95%CI 0.70-1.46). No difference in mortality was observed between ARB and ACEI discontinuation (28.6% vs. 27.1%, respectively), while a significantly lower mortality rate was found among patients who continued with ARBs (20.8%, N=125) as compared to those who continued with ACEIs (33.1%, N=136; p=0.03). The head-to-head comparison (ARB vs. ACEI continuation) yielded an adjusted HR of 0.52 (95%CI 0.29-0.93), being especially notorious among males (HR=0.34; 95%CI 0.12-0.93), subjects older than 74 years (HR=0.46; 95%CI 0.25-0.85), and patients with obesity (HR=0.22; 95%CI 0.05-0.94), diabetes (HR=0.36; 95%CI 0.13-0.97), and heart failure (HR=0.12; 95%CI 0.03-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: The discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs at admission did not improve the in-hospital survival.

262,33967554,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has drawn the scientific community's attention to pre-existing metabolic conditions that could aggravate the infection, causing extended viral shedding, prolonged hospitalization, and high death rates. Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) emerges as a surrogate for COVID-19 severity due to the constellation of metabolic alterations it entails. This review outlines the impact MAFLD exerts on COVID-19 severity in obese subjects, besides the possible mechanistic links to the poor outcomes. The data collected showed that MAFLD patients had poorer COVID-19 outcomes than non-MAFLD obese subjects. MAFLD is generally accompanied by impaired glycemic control and systemic arterial hypertension, both of which can decompensate during the COVID-19 clinical course. Also, MAFLD subjects had higher plasma inflammatory marker concentrations than non-MAFLD subjects, which might be related to an intensified cytokine storm syndrome frequently associated with the need for mechanical ventilation and death. In conclusion, MAFLD represents a higher risk than obesity for COVID-19 severity, resulting in poor outcomes and even progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Hepatologists should include MAFLD subjects in the high-risk group, intensify preventive measurements, and prioritize their vaccination.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has drawn the scientific community's attention to pre-existing metabolic conditions that could aggravate the infection, causing extended viral shedding, prolonged hospitalization, and high death rates.

263,33966881,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: SARS-CoV-2 has been and is a major global Public Health challenge. Since the beginning of the pandemic, different comorbidities have been postulated and associated with spectra of increased severity and mortality. The objectives of this research are: 1) to analyse the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) in a health area in northern Spain; 2) to understand the possible role of influenza vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination in the development of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A test-negative case-control study was conducted. Variables related to personal and vaccination history were considered. Although the epidemiological definition of the case varied over time, the reference definition was that corresponding to 31/01/2020 in Spain. A bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed. RESULTS: The sample included 188 patients, of which 63 were cases and 125 controls. The results show that obesity increases the risk 2.4-fold of suffering this infection (IC 95% 1,301-4,521) and ARA-2 increases it 2.2-fold (95% CI 1,256-6,982). On the other hand, anti-pneumococcal vaccination of 13 serotypes showed results close to statistical significance (OR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.170-1,006). CONCLUSION: Obesity and the use of ARA-2 increases the risk of COVID-19. Scientific knowledge about factors associated with COVID-19 should be expanded.

264,33966355,"OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have unveiled a relationship between the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and obesity. The aims of this multicenter retrospective cohort study were to disentangle the association of BMI and associated metabolic risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking status) in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients admitted to intensive care units for COVID-19 in 21 centers (in Europe, Israel, and the United States) were enrolled in this study between February 19, 2020, and May 19, 2020. Primary and secondary outcomes were the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 28-day mortality, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1,461 patients were enrolled; the median (interquartile range) age was 64 years (40.9-72.0); 73.2% of patients were male; the median BMI was 28.1 kg/m(2) (25.4-32.3); a total of 1,080 patients (73.9%) required IMV; and the 28-day mortality estimate was 36.1% (95% CI: 33.0-39.5). An adjusted mixed logistic regression model showed a significant linear relationship between BMI and IMV: odds ratio = 1.27 (95% CI: 1.12-1.45) per 5 kg/m(2) . An adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model showed a significant association between BMI and mortality, which was increased only in obesity class III (>/=40; hazard ratio = 1.68 [95% CI: 1.06-2.64]).

265,33966260,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the greatest clinical challenges of the last decades. Clinical factors associated with severity of the disease remain unclear. The aim of the study was to characterize Polish patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and to evaluate potential prognostic factors of severe course of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational study was conducted from March to July 2020 in the Pulmonology and Allergology Department of the University Hospital in Krakow, Poland. Consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection were enrolled, and data about past medical history, signs and symptoms, laboratory results, imaging studies results, in-hospital management and outcomes was prospectively gathered. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 100 patients at the mean age of 59.2 (SD 16.1) years among whom 63 (63.0%) were male. Among them 10 (10.0%) died, 47 (47%) presented respiratory failure, 15 (15.0%) were transferred to the intensive care unit, 17 (17.0%) developed acute kidney injury, 7 (7.0%) had sepsis and 10 (10.0%) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. Multivariable analysis revealed age (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.01-1.15), body mass index (BMI; OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.01-1.53), modified early warning score (MEWS; OR 3.95; 95% CI 1.48-12), the highest d-dimer value (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.03-2.9) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.03-1.3) to be associated with severe course of COVID-19.

Consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection were enrolled, and data about past medical history, signs and symptoms, laboratory results, imaging studies results, in-hospital management and outcomes was prospectively gathered. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 100 patients at the mean age of 59.2 (SD 16.1) years among whom 63 (63.0%) were male. Among them 10 (10.0%) died, 47 (47%) presented respiratory failure, 15 (15.0%) were transferred to the intensive care unit, 17 (17.0%) developed acute kidney injury, 7 (7.0%) had sepsis and 10 (10.0%) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. Multivariable analysis revealed age (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.01-1.15), body mass index (BMI; OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.01-1.53), modified early warning score (MEWS; OR 3.95; 95% CI 1.48-12), the highest d-dimer value (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.03-2.9) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.03-1.3) to be associated with severe course of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This observational study showed that almost half of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 developed respiratory failure in the course of the disease.

AIM: We have been appointed by the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) to update with the current statement ESE members and the whole endocrine community on the emerging endocrine phenotype of COVID-19 and its implication for the prevention and management of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes has a major role in this phenotype since it is one of the most frequent comorbidities associated with severity and mortality of COVID-19. Careful management including treatment modifications may be required for protecting our patients rather with known diabetes from the most dangerous consequences of COVID-19 or hospitalized with COVID-19, but also in patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced newly onset diabetes. Obesity increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and the risk for COVID-19 adverse outcome. Adequate nutritional management needs to be granted to patients with obesity or undernourishment in order to limit their increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection.

267,33961213,"INTRODUCTION: Identifying risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19 requiring urgent medical visits and hospitalizations (UMVs) among patients initially diagnosed in the outpatient setting may help inform patient management. The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of and risk factors for COVID-19-related UMVs after outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis or positive SARS-CoV-2 test. METHODS: Data for this retrospective cohort study were from the Optum((R)) de-identified COVID-19 Electronic Health Record database from June 1 to December 9, 2020. Adults with first COVID-19 diagnosis or positive SARS-CoV-2 test in outpatient settings were identified. Cumulative incidence function analysis stratified by risk factors was used to estimate the 30-day incidence of COVID-19-related UMVs. Competing risk regression models were used to derive adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for factors associated with UMVs. RESULTS: Among 206,741 patients [58.8% female, 77.5% non-Hispanic Caucasian, mean (SD) age: 46.7 (17.8) years], the 30-day incidence was 9.4% (95% CI 9.3-9.6) for COVID-19-related emergency room (ER)/urgent care (UC)/hospitalizations and 3.8% (95% CI 3.7-3.9) for COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Likelihood of hospitalization increased with age and body mass index, with age the strongest risk factor (aHR 5.61; 95% CI 4.90-6.32 for patients >/= 85 years). Increased likelihood of hospitalization was observed for first presentation in the ER/UC vs. non-ER/UC outpatient settings (aHR 2.35; 95% CI 2.22-2.47) and prior all-cause hospitalization (aHR 1.90; 95% CI 1.79-2.00). Clinical risk factors of hospitalizations included pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and autoimmune disease. A study limitation is that data on COVID-19 severity and symptoms were not captured. CONCLUSION: Predictors of COVID-19-related UMVs include older age, obesity, and several comorbidities. These findings may inform patient management and resource allocation following outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis.","INTRODUCTION: Identifying risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19 requiring urgent medical visits and hospitalizations (UMVs) among patients initially diagnosed in the outpatient setting may help inform patient management.

Altered immune cell metabolism and function are often perceived as a key causative factor of dysregulated inflammation. However, the contribution of adipocytes, the dominantly altered cell type in obesity with broad inflammatory properties, to infectious disease pathogenesis remains largely ignored. Thus, skewing of adipocyte-intrinsic cellular metabolism may lead to the development of pathogenic inflammatory adipocytes, which shape the overall immune responses by contributing to either premature immunosenescence, delayed hyperinflammation, or cytokine storm in infections. In this review, we discuss the underappreciated contribution of adipocyte cellular metabolism and adipocyte-produced mediators on immune system modulation and how such interplay may modify disease susceptibility and pathogenesis of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections in obese individuals.","Epidemiological evidence establishes obesity as an independent risk factor for increased susceptibility and severity to viral respiratory pneumonias associated with H1N1 influenza and SARS-CoV-2 pandemics.

270,33955183,"OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses the host's angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular entry point. Therefore, modulating ACE2 might impact SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, shedding, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. Here, it was investigated whether the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker valsartan alters the expression of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, including ACE2, in human adipose tissue (AT) and skeletal muscle. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed, in which 36 participants (BMI 31.0 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2) ) with impaired glucose metabolism received either valsartan or placebo for 26 weeks. Before and after 26 weeks' treatment, abdominal subcutaneous AT and skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained, and gene expression of RAS components was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Valsartan treatment did not significantly impact the expression of RAS components, including ACE2, in AT and skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Given the pivotal role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 spread and the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, the data suggest that the putative beneficial effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers on the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 may not be mediated through altered ACE2 expression in abdominal subcutaneous AT.","OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses the host's angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular entry point.

272,33945220,"OBJECTIVE: Obesity is associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Disease severity is associated with a higher COVID-19 antibody titer. The COVID-19 antibody titer response of patients with obesity versus patients without obesity was compared. METHODS: The data of individuals tested for COVID-19 serology at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City between March 1, 2020, and December 14, 2021, were retrospectively retrieved. The primary outcome was peak antibody titer, assessed as a binary variable (1:2,880, which was the highest detected titer, versus lower than 1:2,880). In patients with a positive serology test, peak titer rates were compared between BMI groups (<18.5, 18.5 to 25, 25 to 30, 30 to 40, and >/=40 kg/m(2) ). A multivariable logistic regression model was used to analyze the independent association between different BMI groups and peak titer. RESULTS: Overall, 39,342 individuals underwent serology testing and had BMI measurements. A positive serology test was present in 12,314 patients. Peak titer rates were associated with obesity (BMI < 18.5 [34.5%], 18.5 to 25 [29.2%], 25 to 30 [37.7%], 30 to 40 [44.7%], >/=40 [52.0%]; p < 0.001). In a multivariable analysis, severe obesity had the highest adjusted odds ratio for peak titer (95% CI: 2.1-3.0). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 neutralizing antibody titer is associated with obesity. This has implications on the understanding of the role of obesity in COVID-19 severity.","OBJECTIVE: Obesity is associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.

Peak titer rates were associated with obesity (BMI < 18.5 [34.5%], 18.5 to 25 [29.2%], 25 to 30 [37.7%], 30 to 40 [44.7%], >/=40 [52.0%]; p < 0.001). In a multivariable analysis, severe obesity had the highest adjusted odds ratio for peak titer (95% CI: 2.1-3.0). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 neutralizing antibody titer is associated with obesity.

273,33939057,"BACKGROUND: Despite COVID-19 being identified as severe respiratory viral infection, progressively many relevant endocrine manifestations have been reported greatly contributing to the severity of the clinical presentation. Systemic involvement in COVID-19 is due to the ubiquitous expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, responsible for the entry in the cells of SARS-CoV-2, Several reports in humans and animal models showed a significant ACE2 mRNA expression in hypothalamus and pituitary cells. Moreover, higher mortality and poorer outcomes have been widely described in COVID-19 patients with obesity, diabetes and vertebral fractures, which are all highly prevalent in subjects with pituitary dysfunctions. AIM: To review the main endocrine manifestations of COVID-19 with their possible implications for pituitary diseases, the possible direct and indirect involvement of the pituitary gland in COVID-19, the impact of COVID-19 on the management of established pituitary diseases which can be already at increased risk for worse outcomes and on neurosurgical activities as well as vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our review underlines that there could be a specific involvement of the pituitary gland which fits into a progressively shaping endocrine phenotype of COVID-19. Moreover, the care for pituitary diseases need to continue despite the restrictions due to the emergency. Several pituitary diseases, such as hypopituitarism and Cushing disease, or due to frequent comorbidities such as diabetes may be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in affected patients.

In this study, we analyzed the association between obesity and COVID-19 outcome (death, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, mechanical ventilation needs, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [qSOFA] score, and confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure [CURB-65] scores) for hospitalized diabetic patients. Methods: In this prospective hospital-based registry of patients with COVID-19 in East Azerbaijan, Iran, 368 consecutive diabetic patients with COVID-19 were followed from admission until discharge or death. Self-reported weight and height were used to calculate body mass index (kg/m(2)) upon admission. Our primary endpoint was analyzing obesity and COVID-19 mortality association. Assessing the associations among obesity and disease severity, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation was our secondary endpoint. Results: We analyzed data from 317 patients and found no significant difference between obese and non-obese patients regarding frequency of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, CURB-65, or qSOFA scores (P>0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors, obese diabetic COVID-19 patients were 2.72 times more likely to die than non-obese patients. Moreover, ventilator dependence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.76) and ICU admission (aOR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.11-5.68) odds were significantly higher for obese patients than non-obese patients.

277,33920604,"Emerging data suggest that obesity is a major risk factor for the progression of major complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the link between obesity and disease severity as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the development of new therapeutic interventions and preventive measures in this high-risk group. We propose that multiple features of obesity contribute to the prevalence of severe COVID-19 and complications. First, viral entry can be facilitated by the upregulation of viral entry receptors, like angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), among others. Second, obesity-induced chronic inflammation and disruptions of insulin and leptin signaling can result in impaired viral clearance and a disproportionate or hyper-inflammatory response, which together with elevated ferritin levels can be a direct cause for ARDS and cytokine storm. Third, the negative consequences of obesity on blood coagulation can contribute to the progression of thrombus formation and hemorrhage. In this review we first summarize clinical findings on the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 disease severity and then further discuss potential mechanisms that could explain the risk for major complications in patients suffering from obesity.","Emerging data suggest that obesity is a major risk factor for the progression of major complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 1003 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was conducted. Longitudinal liver function tests and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Abnormal liver function parameters were observed, both at admission (ALT 13.2%, AST 8.5%, ALP 2.0%, GGT 7.4%, LDH 37.6%, TBIL 4.0%, DBIL 7.8%, Albumin 10.1%) and peak hospitalization (ALT 29.4%, AST 17.5%, ALP 2.6%, GGT 13.4%, LDH 49.4%, TBIL 10.1%, DBIL 18.0%, Albumin 30.6%) in patients with COVID-19.

282,33909265,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A growing body of evidence suggests that obesity and increased visceral adiposity are strongly and independently linked to adverse outcomes and death due to COVID-19. This review summarizes current epidemiologic data, highlights pathogenetic mechanisms on the association between excess body weight and COVID-19, compares data from previous pandemics, discusses why COVID-19 challenges the ""obesity paradox,"" and presents implications in prevention and treatment as well as future perspectives. RECENT FINDINGS: Data from meta-analyses based on recent observational studies have indicated that obesity increases the risks of infection from SARS-CoV-2, severe infection and hospitalization, admission to the ICU and need of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and the risk of mortality, particularly in severe obesity. The risks of IMV and mortality associated with obesity are accentuated in younger individuals (age </= 50 years old). The meta-inflammation in obesity intersects with and exacerbates underlying pathogenetic mechanisms in COVID-19 through the following mechanisms and factors: (i) impaired innate and adaptive immune responses; (ii) chronic inflammation and oxidative stress; (iii) endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and aberrant activation of the complement; (iv) overactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; (v) overexpression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in the adipose tissue; (vi) associated cardiometabolic comorbidities; (vii) vitamin D deficiency; (viii) gut dysbiosis; and (ix) mechanical and psychological issues.

The objective of this study is to analyse clinical and epidemiological characteristics of a cohort of women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and their newborns exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during gestation. METHODS: Multicentric observational study of Spanish hospitals from the GESNEO-COVD cohort, participants in RECLIP (Spanish Network of Paediatric Clinical Assays). Women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR and/or serology during pregnancy, diagnosed and delivering during the period 15/03/2020-31/07/2020 were included. Epidemiological, clinical, and analytical data was collected. RESULTS: A total of 105 pregnant women with a median of 34.1 years old (IQR: 28.8-37.1) and 107 newborns were included. Globally, almost 65% of pregnant women had some COVID-19 symptoms and more than 43% were treated for SARS-COV-2. Overall, 30.8% of pregnant women had pneumonia and 5 (4.8%) women were admitted to the intensive care unit needing invasive mechanical ventilation. There was a rate of 36.2% of caesarean sections, which was associated with pneumonia during pregnancy (OR: 4.203, CI 95%: 1.473-11.995) and lower gestational age at delivery (OR: 0.724, CI 95%: 0.578-0.906). The prevalence of preterm birth was 20.6% and prematurity was associated with pneumonia during gestation (OR: 6.970, CI95%: 2.340-22.750) and having a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR at delivery (OR: 6.520, CI95%: 1.840-31.790). All nasopharyngeal PCR in newborns were negative at birth and one positivized at 15 days of life. Two newborns died, one due to causes related to prematurity and another of unexpected sudden death during early skin-to-skin contact after delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Although vertical transmission has not been reported in this cohort, the prognosis of newborns could be worsened by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy as COVID-19 pneumonia increased the risk of caesarean section deliveries and preterm births.","BACKGROUND: Knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy and newborns is scarce.

286,33883027,"BACKGROUND: The large airway epithelial barrier provides one of the first lines of defense against respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. Substantial inter-individual variability in individual disease courses is hypothesized to be partially mediated by the differential regulation of the genes that interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or are involved in the subsequent host response. Here, we comprehensively investigated non-genetic and genetic factors influencing COVID-19-relevant bronchial epithelial gene expression. METHODS: We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from bronchial epithelial brushings obtained from uninfected individuals. We related ACE2 gene expression to host and environmental factors in the SPIROMICS cohort of smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and replicated these associations in two asthma cohorts, SARP and MAST. To identify airway biology beyond ACE2 binding that may contribute to increased susceptibility, we used gene set enrichment analyses to determine if gene expression changes indicative of a suppressed airway immune response observed early in SARS-CoV-2 infection are also observed in association with host factors. To identify host genetic variants affecting COVID-19 susceptibility in SPIROMICS, we performed expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping and investigated the phenotypic associations of the eQTL variants. RESULTS: We found that ACE2 expression was higher in relation to active smoking, obesity, and hypertension that are known risk factors of COVID-19 severity, while an association with interferon-related inflammation was driven by the truncated, non-binding ACE2 isoform. We discovered that expression patterns of a suppressed airway immune response to early SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other viruses, are similar to patterns associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which may thus contribute to a COVID-19-susceptible airway environment. eQTL mapping identified regulatory variants for genes implicated in COVID-19, some of which had pheWAS evidence for their potential role in respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that clinically relevant variation in the expression of COVID-19-related genes is associated with host factors, environmental exposures, and likely host genetic variation.","BACKGROUND: The large airway epithelial barrier provides one of the first lines of defense against respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19.

288,33868185,"Background: Overburdened healthcare systems during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to suboptimal chronic disease management, including that of pediatric type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The pandemic also caused delayed detection of new-onset diabetes in children; this increased the risk and severity of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We therefore investigated the frequency of new-onset pediatric T1DM and DKA in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared it to the same period in 2019. Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study, including patients aged 1-14 years admitted with new-onset T1DM or DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) and the same period in 2019. We assessed factors including age, sex, anthropometric measures, nationality, duration of diabetes, diabetes management, HbA1c levels, glycemic control, cause of admission, blood gas levels, etiology of DKA, DKA complications, length of hospital stay, and COVID-19 test status. Result: During the lockdown, 106 children, compared with 154 in 2019, were admitted to 6 pediatric diabetes centers. Among the admissions, DKA was higher in 2020 than in 2019 (83% vs. 73%; P=0.05; risk ratio=1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.26), after adjusting for age and sex. DKA frequency among new-onset T1DM and HbA1c levels at diagnosis were higher in 2020 than in 2019 (26% vs. 13.4% [P=<0.001] and 12.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 10.8 +/- 0.25 [P<0.001], respectively). Females and older patients had a higher risk of DKA. Conclusion: The lockdown implemented in Saudi Arabia has significantly impacted children with T1DM and led to an increased DKA frequency, including children with new-onset T1DM, potentially owing to delayed presentation.","Background: Overburdened healthcare systems during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to suboptimal chronic disease management, including that of pediatric type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The pandemic also caused delayed detection of new-onset diabetes in children; this increased the risk and severity of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We therefore investigated the frequency of new-onset pediatric T1DM and DKA in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared it to the same period in 2019. Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study, including patients aged 1-14 years admitted with new-onset T1DM or DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) and the same period in 2019. We assessed factors including age, sex, anthropometric measures, nationality, duration of diabetes, diabetes management, HbA1c levels, glycemic control, cause of admission, blood gas levels, etiology of DKA, DKA complications, length of hospital stay, and COVID-19 test status. Result: During the lockdown, 106 children, compared with 154 in 2019, were admitted to 6 pediatric diabetes centers. Among the admissions, DKA was higher in 2020 than in 2019 (83% vs. 73%; P=0.05; risk ratio=1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.26), after adjusting for age and sex. DKA frequency among new-onset T1DM and HbA1c levels at diagnosis were higher in 2020 than in 2019 (26% vs. 13.4% [P=<0.001] and 12.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 10.8 +/- 0.25 [P<0.001], respectively).

Furthermore, COVID-19 pandemic joins the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome in western countries. Patients suffering from obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, cardiac involvement and metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) have enhanced risk of suffering severe COVID-19 and mortality. Importantly, up to 25% of the population in western countries is susceptible of suffering from both MAFLD and COVID-19, while none approved treatment is currently available for any of them. Moreover, it is well known that exacerbated innate immune responses are key in the development of the most severe stages of MAFLD and COVID-19. In this review, we focus on the role of the immune system in the establishment and progression of MAFLD and discuss its potential implication in the development of severe COVID-19 in MAFLD patients. As a result, we hope to clarify their common pathology, but also uncover new potential therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for further research.","The coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has hit the world, affecting health, medical care, economies and our society as a whole.

290,33858854,"OBJECTIVE: Obesity is an established risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the contribution of overweight and/or diabetes remains unclear. In a multicenter, international study, we investigated if overweight, obesity, and diabetes were independently associated with COVID-19 severity and whether the BMI-associated risk was increased among those with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively extracted data from health care records and regional databases of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 from 18 sites in 11 countries. We used standardized definitions and analyses to generate site-specific estimates, modeling the odds of each outcome (supplemental oxygen/noninvasive ventilatory support, invasive mechanical ventilatory support, and in-hospital mortality) by BMI category (reference, overweight, obese), adjusting for age, sex, and prespecified comorbidities. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with preexisting diabetes. Site-specific estimates were combined in a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Among 7,244 patients (65.6% overweight/obese), those with overweight were more likely to require oxygen/noninvasive ventilatory support (random effects adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.44; 95% CI 1.15-1.80) and invasive mechanical ventilatory support (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.03-1.46). There was no association between overweight and in-hospital mortality (aOR, 0.88; 95% CI 0.74-1.04). Similar effects were observed in patients with obesity or diabetes. In the subgroup analysis, the aOR for any outcome was not additionally increased in those with diabetes and overweight or obesity. CONCLUSIONS: In adults hospitalized with COVID-19, overweight, obesity, and diabetes were associated with increased odds of requiring respiratory support but were not associated with death.

Therefore, we conducted Ovid MEDLINE and Embase database searches of basic science studies investigating the impact of the biological variable of sex on ACE2 expression and regulation from 2000, the year ACE2 was discovered, through December 31, 2020. Out of 2,131 publications, we identified 853 original research articles on ACE2 conducted in primary cells, tissues, and/or whole mammals excluding humans. The majority (68.7%) of these studies that cited the sex of the animal were conducted in males, while 11.2% were conducted solely in females; 9.26% compared ACE2 between the sexes, while 10.8% did not report the sex of the animals used. General findings are that sex differences are tissue-specific and when present, are dependent upon gonadal state. Renal, cardiac, and adipose ACE2 is increased in both sexes under experimental conditions that model co-morbidities associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes including hypertension, obesity, and renal and cardiovascular diseases; however, ACE2 protein was generally higher in the males. Studies in Ace2 knockout mice indicate ACE2 plays a greater role in protecting the female from developing hypertension than the male. Studying the biological variable of sex in ACE2 research provides an opportunity for discovery in conditions involving RAS dysfunction and will shed light on sex differences in COVID-19 severity.","Throughout the world, including the United States, men have worse outcomes from COVID-19 than women.

297,33829849,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Compared with adults, children with SARS-CoV-2 infection may have fewer and less severe symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly reported in children, sometimes as the only manifestation of the disease, and most often manifest as anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, or abdominal pain. Although most children have asymptomatic or mild disease, 10 % of those infected may experience serious or critical disease, or even death. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a rare but serious condition recently reported in children with COVID-19. Studies indicate that children with obesity are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, and inflammation associated with obesity could be one of the factors that worsens COVID-19 symptoms due to an increased inflammatory response involving molecules such as interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein. On the other hand, evidence has been reported of a higher protein expression of ACE2 in the visceral adipose tissue of obese and malnourished humans, and this could be associated with complications and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, regulation of the intake of macronutrients or micronutrients could be used as a strategy to reduce the consequences of COVID-19. Diet in general and bioactive compounds could play an important role in the prevention of the inflammatory cascade. The micronutrients with the most evidence suggesting a role in immune support are vitamins C and D, zinc, and polyphenols.","INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

298,33824998,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has proven a challenge to healthcare systems since its first appearance in late 2019. The global spread and devastating effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on patients have resulted in countless studies on risk factors and disease progression. Overweight and obesity emerged as one of the major risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. Here we review the biology of coronavirus infections in relation to obesity. In particular, we review literature about the impact of adiposity-related systemic inflammation on the COVID-19 disease severity, involving cytokine, chemokine, leptin, and growth hormone signaling, and we discuss the involvement of hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Due to the sheer number of publications on COVID-19, we cannot be completed, and therefore, we apologize for all the publications that we do not cite.","The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has proven a challenge to healthcare systems since its first appearance in late 2019.

299,33823118,"Rationale: The role of and needs for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at a population level during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have not been completely established. Objectives: To identify the cumulative incidence of ECMO use in the first pandemic wave and to describe the Nationwide Chilean cohort of ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a population-based study from March 3 to August 31, 2020, using linked data from national agencies. The cumulative incidence of ECMO use and mortality risk of ECMO-supported patients were calculated and age standardized. In addition, a retrospective cohort analysis was performed. Outcomes were 90-day mortality after ECMO initiation, ECMO-associated complications, and hospital length of stay. Cox regression models were used to explore risk factors for mortality in a time-to-event analysis. Measurements and Main Results: Ninety-four patients with COVID-19 were supported with ECMO (0.42 per population of 100,000, 14.89 per 100,000 positive cases, and 1.2% of intubated patients with COVID-19); 85 were included in the cohort analysis, and the median age was 48 (interquartile range [IQR], 41-55) years, 83.5% were men, and 42.4% had obesity. The median number of pre-ECMO intubation days was 4 (IQR, 2-7), the median PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 86.8 (IQR, 64-99) mm Hg, 91.8% of patients were prone positioned, and 14 patients had refractory respiratory acidosis. Main complications were infections (70.6%), bleeding (38.8%), and thromboembolism (22.4%); 52 patients were discharged home, and 33 died. The hospital length of stay was a median of 50 (IQR, 24-69) days. Lower respiratory system compliance and higher driving pressure before ECMO initiation were associated with increased mortality. A duration of pre-ECMO intubation >/=10 days was not associated with mortality. Conclusions: Documenting nationwide ECMO needs may help in planning ECMO provision for future COVID-19 pandemic waves. The 90-day mortality of the Chilean cohort of ECMO-supported patients with COVID-19 (38.8%) is comparable to that of previous reports.","Rationale: The role of and needs for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at a population level during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have not been completely established.

300,33821453,"PURPOSE: Chest X-ray (CXR) severity score and BMI-based obesity are predictive risk factors for COVID-19 hospital admission. However, the relationship between abdominal obesity and CXR severity score has not yet been fully explored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the association of different adiposity indexes, including waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), with CXR severity score in 215 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients with abdominal obesity showed significantly higher CXR severity scores and had higher rates of CXR severity scores >/= 8 compared to those without abdominal obesity (P < 0.001; P = 0.001, respectively). By contrast, patients with normal weight, with overweight and those with BMI-based obesity showed no significant differences in either CXR severity scores or in the rates of CXR severity scores >/= 8 (P = 0.104; P = 0.271, respectively). Waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) correlated more closely with CXR severity scores than BMI (r = 0.43, P < 0.001; r = 0.41, P < 0.001; r = 0.17, P = 0.012, respectively). The area under the curves (AUCs) for waist circumference and WHtR were significantly higher than that for BMI in identifying a high CXR severity score (>/= 8) (0.68 [0.60-0.75] and 0.67 [0.60-0.74] vs 0.58 [0.51-0.66], P = 0.001).

Among all patients, those with diabetes or hyperglycemia have a two- to four-fold increase in mortality and severity of COVID-19 than those without diabetes. The primary cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients with diabetes is compromised immune response to viral infections. Increased blood sugar level probably affects intracellular degradation of bacteria, neutrophil chemotaxis, and phagocytosis, thus improving viral binding affinity and entry and decreasing virus clearance. In addition, it has significant effects on the proteins by inducing glycosylation and altering the composition of complements, and glycosylation renders cells susceptible to viral inflammation and damage. The treatment of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes requires an integrated team approach to minimize the risk of medical complications and mortality.

302,33803339,"Malnutrition is common among severe patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), mainly elderly adults and patients with comorbidities. It is also associated with atypical presentation of the disease. Despite the possible contribution of malnutrition to the acquisition and severity of COVID-19, it is not clear which nutritional screening measures may best diagnose malnutrition in these patients at early stages. This is of crucial importance given the urgency and rapid progression of the disease in vulnerable groups. Accordingly, this review examines the available literature for different nutritional screening approaches implemented among COVID-19 patients, with a special focus on elderly adults. After a literature search, we selected and scrutinized 14 studies assessing malnutrition among COVID-19 patients. The Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) has demonstrated superior sensitivity to other traditional screening measures. The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, which comprises serum albumin level, cholesterol level, and lymphocytes count, as well as a combined CONUT-lactate dehydrogenase-C-reactive protein score expressed a predictive capacity even superior to that of NRS-2002 (0.81% and 0.92% vs. 0.79%) in midlife and elder COVID-19 patients. Therefore, simple measures based on routinely conducted laboratory investigations such as the CONUT score may be timely, cheap, and valuable alternatives for identifying COVID-19 patients with high nutritional risk. Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) was the only measure used to detect residual malnutrition and high malnutrition risk in remitting patients-MNA scores correlated with hypoalbuminemia, hypercytokinemia, and weight loss. Older males with severe inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, and pre-existing comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, or hypertension) are more prone to malnutrition and subsequently poor COVID-19 prognosis both during the acute phase and during convalescence.

The unknown mechanisms of infection used by SARS-CoV-2 and the absence of effective antiviral pharmacological therapy, diagnosis methods, and vaccines evoked scientific efforts on the COVID-19 outcome. In general, COVID-19 clinical features are a result of local and systemic inflammatory processes that are enhanced by some preexistent comorbidities, such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular, and pulmonary diseases, and biological factors, like gender and age. However, the discrepancies in COVID-19 clinical signs observed among those patients lead to investigations about the critical factors that deeply influence disease severity and death. Herein, we present the viral infection mechanisms and its consequences after blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) axis in different tissues and the progression of inflammatory and immunological reactions, especially the influence of genetic features on those differential clinical responses. Furthermore, we discuss the role of genotype as an essential indicator of COVID-19 susceptibility, considering the expression profiles, polymorphisms, gene identification, and epigenetic modifications of viral entry factors and their recognition, as well as the infection effects on cell signaling molecule expression, which amplifies disease severity.","In the last year, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic brought a new consideration for the multidisciplinary sciences.

Herein, we present the viral infection mechanisms and its consequences after blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) axis in different tissues and the progression of inflammatory and immunological reactions, especially the influence of genetic features on those differential clinical responses. Furthermore, we discuss the role of genotype as an essential indicator of COVID-19 susceptibility, considering the expression profiles, polymorphisms, gene identification, and epigenetic modifications of viral entry factors and their recognition, as well as the infection effects on cell signaling molecule expression, which amplifies disease severity.",Guilger-Casagrande M, P,Journal Article," In the last year, the advent of the COVID-19<br>pandemic brought a new consideration for the<br>multidisciplinary sciences.

307,33785495,"OBJECTIVE: To assess medium-term organ impairment in symptomatic individuals following recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Baseline findings from a prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING: Community-based individuals from two UK centres between 1 April and 14 September 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals >/=18 years with persistent symptoms following recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and age-matched healthy controls. INTERVENTION: Assessment of symptoms by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12) and organ-specific metrics by biochemical assessment and quantitative MRI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Severe post-COVID-19 syndrome defined as ongoing respiratory symptoms and/or moderate functional impairment in activities of daily living; single-organ and multiorgan impairment (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) by consensus definitions at baseline investigation. RESULTS: 201 individuals (mean age 45, range 21-71 years, 71% female, 88% white, 32% healthcare workers) completed the baseline assessment (median of 141 days following SARS-CoV-2 infection, IQR 110-162). The study population was at low risk of COVID-19 mortality (obesity 20%, hypertension 7%, type 2 diabetes 2%, heart disease 5%), with only 19% hospitalised with COVID-19. 42% of individuals had 10 or more symptoms and 60% had severe post-COVID-19 syndrome. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (87%), breathlessness (88%) and headaches (83%) were most frequently reported. Mild organ impairment was present in the heart (26%), lungs (11%), kidneys (4%), liver (28%), pancreas (40%) and spleen (4%), with single-organ and multiorgan impairment in 70% and 29%, respectively. Hospitalisation was associated with older age (p=0.001), non-white ethnicity (p=0.016), increased liver volume (p<0.0001), pancreatic inflammation (p<0.01), and fat accumulation in the liver (p<0.05) and pancreas (p<0.01). Severe post-COVID-19 syndrome was associated with radiological evidence of cardiac damage (myocarditis) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In individuals at low risk of COVID-19 mortality with ongoing symptoms, 70% have impairment in one or more organs 4 months after initial COVID-19 symptoms, with implications for healthcare and public health, which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a nationwide retrospective cohort study that was conducted in Mexico. METHODS: Data from 258 reinfection cases (at least 28 days between both episodes onset) were analyzed. We used risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate predictors of severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The risk of severe disease was 14.7%, and the observed overall fatality rate was 4.3%. Patients with more serious primary disease were more likely to develop severe symptoms (39.5% vs. 5.5%, P < 0.001) during reinfection.

This study compares psychological symptoms among these two groups. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 938 HCWs from various medical fields working in the leading general hospitals of Alborz province, Iran, were selected using a multistage sampling method. The participants had contact with COVID-19 patients. Post-traumatic stress disorder-8 (PTSD-8) is a validated questionnaire that we used to evaluate PTSD symptoms along with its subscales, including intrusion, avoidance, and hypervigilance. Also, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 questionnaire was used to assess the severity of the aforementioned conditions in HCWs. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare psychological symptoms in infected and non-infected HCWs. RESULTS: Among 938 included HCWs, 55 had a history of confirmed COVID-19 infection. Prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, intrusion, hypervigilance, and avoidance among infected HCWs were significantly higher in comparison to non-infected HCWs. In the multivariate logistic model, history of COVID-19 infection among HCWs was associated with a significantly increased risk of anxiety, depression, stress, intrusion, hyper-vigilance, and avoidance. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that the HCWs with COVID-19 infection were at a high risk of displaying psychological symptoms. Therefore, it is also necessary to develop psychological support and interventions for HCWs, especially those who got infected with the virus.","BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that health care workers (HCWs), as front liners of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, are at high risk for psychological symptoms, but few studies have compared these symptoms in infected and non-infected HCWs.

Prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, intrusion, hypervigilance, and avoidance among infected HCWs were significantly higher in comparison to non-infected HCWs. In the multivariate logistic model, history of COVID-19 infection among HCWs was associated with a significantly increased risk of anxiety, depression, stress, intrusion, hyper-vigilance, and avoidance.

313,33767855,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the risk factors for poor outcomes among COVID-19 patients could help identify vulnerable populations who would need prioritisation in prevention and treatment for COVID-19. We aimed to critically appraise and synthesise published evidence on the risk factors for poor outcomes in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed, medRxiv and the WHO COVID-19 literature database for studies that reported characteristics of COVID-19 patients who required hospitalisation. We included studies published between January and May 2020 that reported adjusted effect size of any demographic and/or clinical factors for any of the three poor outcomes: mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation. We appraised the quality of the included studies using Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools and quantitatively synthesised the evidence through a series of random-effect meta-analyses. To aid data interpretation, we further developed an interpretation framework that indicated strength of the evidence, informed by both quantity and quality of the evidence. RESULTS: We included a total of 40 studies in our review. Most of the included studies (29/40, 73%) were assessed as ""good quality"", with assessment scores of 80 or more. We found that male sex (pooled odds ratio (OR) = 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18-1.48; 20 studies), older age (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.04-1.07, per one year of age increase; 10 studies), obesity (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.02-2.48; 4 studies), diabetes (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.11-1.40; 11 studies) and chronic kidney diseases (6 studies; OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.27-1.93) were associated with increased risks for mortality with the greatest strength of evidence based on our interpretation framework. We did not find increased risk of mortality for several factors including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (5 studies), cancer (4 studies), or current smoker (5 studies); however, this does not indicate absence of risk due to limited data on each of these factors. CONCLUSION: Male sex, older age, obesity, diabetes and chronic kidney diseases are important risk factors of COVID-19 poor outcomes. Our review provides not only an appraisal and synthesis of evidence on the risk factors of COVID-19 poor outcomes, but also a data interpretation framework that could be adopted by relevant future research.","BACKGROUND: Understanding the risk factors for poor outcomes among COVID-19 patients could help identify vulnerable populations who would need prioritisation in prevention and treatment for COVID-19.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of dysphonia, and its severity and extent, of voice fatigue and of dysphagia in non hospitalized patients affected by COVID-19 in Lombardy, the Italian region most hit by the first explosive outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of 160 consecutive patients, with COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by nasal swabs processed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, were gathered by means of telephone interviews performed by physicians in charge of daily follow-up. General and specific symptoms concerning voice and swallowing impairment were investigated. Dysphonia grade and duration were graded on 4-point scales, while voice fatigue was graded on a 5-point scale. RESULTS: Dysphonia was reported by 70 (43.7%) patients and was positively associated with voice fatigue (P < 0.001), cough (P = 0.005), rhinitis (P = 0.01), and dyspnea (P = 0.06); it was mild and/or moderate in 69 patients, but its duration was > 2 weeks in 33/70 (47.1%) patients and >1 month in 11/70 (15.7%). Grade and duration of dysphonia were positively associated with cough and rhinitis (all P values < 0.01). Voice fatigue was reported by 43/160 patients (26.8%) and its severity was correlated with dysphonia (P < 0.0001), cough (P = 0.02), rhinitis (P = 0.02), dyspnea (P < 0.001), and loss of appetite (P = 0.01). Dysphagia was encountered in 27/160 patients (16.9%) and was associated with dysgeusia, cough, arthralgia, myalgia and loss of appetite but not with dysphonia. CONCLUSIONS: Dysphonia was a highly prevalent and long-lasting symptom in this series; it has been underestimated to date.

315,33765600,"The high prevalence of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities has reached pandemic proportions, particularly in Western countries. Obesity increases the risk to develop several chronic noncommunicable disease, ultimately contributing to reduced survival. Recently, obesity has been recognized as major risk factor for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related prognosis, contributing to worse outcomes in those with established COVID-19. Particularly, obesity has been associated with higher hospitalization rates in acute or intensive care and greater risk for invasive mechanical ventilation than lean people. Obesity is characterized by metabolic impairments and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation that causes a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, further aggravating the cytokine production and risk of cytokine storm response during Sars-Cov2 sepsis or other secondary infections. Moreover, the metabolic dysregulations are closely related to an impaired immune system and altered response to viral infection that can ultimately lead to a greater susceptibility to infections, longer viral shedding and greater duration of illness and severity of the disease. In individuals with obesity, maintaining a healthy diet, remaining physically active and reducing sedentary behaviors are particularly important during COVID-19-related quarantine to reduce metabolic and immune impairments. Moreover, such stategies are of utmost importance to reduce the risk for sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity, and to prevent a reduction and potentially even increase cardiorespiratory fitness, a well-known independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and recently found to be a risk factor also for hospitalizations secondary to COVID-19. Such lifestyle strategies may ultimately reduce morbility and mortality in patients with infectious disease, especially in those with concomitant obesity. The aim of this review is to discuss how obesity might increase the risk of COVID-19 and potentially affect its prognosis once COVID-19 is diagnosed. We therefore advocate for implementation of strategies aimed at preventing obesity in the first place, but also to minimize the metabolic anomalies that may lead to a compromized immune response and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, especially in patients with COVID-19.","The high prevalence of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities has reached pandemic proportions, particularly in Western countries.

A total of 133 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital from February 22, 2020, to August 23. After excluding asymptomatic, non-Japanese, pediatric, pregnant patients and also those who needed oxygen immediately at admission, data of the remaining 84 patients were analyzed. The patients were separated into those who required oxygen after admission and those who did not, and their characteristics were compared. Age, body mass index (BMI), lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase, estimated glomerular filtration rate, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were significantly different between the two groups. Multivariate analysis identified four significant and independent risk factors of oxygen requirement, including advanced age, obesity, glucose intolerance and lymphocytopenia. Dividing the patients into subgroups according to the number of these risk factors found in each patient indicated that the need for oxygen increased with higher number of these risk factors in the same individual. Our results suggest that the presence of higher number of these risk factors in COVID-19 patients is associated with future oxygen requirement and that this index can be potentially useful in triaging COVID-19 patients staying home in the context of need for hospitalization.","At the current time of rising demand for hospital beds, it is important to triage COVID-19 patients according to the treatment needed during hospitalization.

There are limited data on how such social determinants of health, including neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, affect the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine how social determinants of health are associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 illness in hospitalized pregnant patients in New York during the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study evaluated all pregnant patients who delivered and had polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between March 15, 2020, and June 15, 2020, at 7 hospitals within Northwell Health, the largest academic health system in New York. During the study period, universal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing protocols were implemented at all sites. Polymerase chain reaction testing was performed using nasopharyngeal swabs. Patients were excluded if the following variables were not available: polymerase chain reaction results, race, ethnicity, or zone improvement plan (ZIP) code of residence. Clinical data were obtained from the enterprise electronic health record system. For each patient, ZIP code was used as a proxy for neighborhood. Socioeconomic characteristics were determined by linking to ZIP code data from the United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey and the Internal Revenue Service's Statistics of Income Division. Specific variables of interest included mean persons per household, median household income, percent unemployment, and percent with less than high school education. Medical records were manually reviewed for all subjects with positive polymerase chain reaction test results to correctly identify symptomatic patients and then classify those subjects using the National Institutes of Health severity of illness categories. Classification was based on the highest severity of illness throughout gestation and not necessarily at the time of presentation for delivery. RESULTS: A total of 4873 patients were included in the study. The polymerase chain reaction test positivity rate was 11% (n=544). Among this group, 359 patients (66%) were asymptomatic or presymptomatic, 115 (21%) had mild or moderate coronavirus disease 2019, and 70 (13%) had severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019. On multiple logistic regression modeling, pregnant patients who had a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were more likely to be younger or of higher parity, belong to minoritized racial and ethnic groups, have public health insurance, have limited English proficiency, and reside in low-income neighborhoods with less educational attainment. On ordinal logit regression modeling, obesity, income and education were associated with coronavirus disease 2019 severity. CONCLUSION: Social and physical determinants of health play a role in determining the risk of infection. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 illness was not associated with race or ethnicity but was associated with maternal obesity and neighborhood level characteristics such as educational attainment and household income.","BACKGROUND: The social and physical environments in which people live affect the emergence, prevalence, and severity of both infectious and noninfectious diseases.

Patients were excluded if the following variables were not available: polymerase chain reaction results, race, ethnicity, or zone improvement plan (ZIP) code of residence. Clinical data were obtained from the enterprise electronic health record system. For each patient, ZIP code was used as a proxy for neighborhood. Socioeconomic characteristics were determined by linking to ZIP code data from the United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey and the Internal Revenue Service's Statistics of Income Division. Specific variables of interest included mean persons per household, median household income, percent unemployment, and percent with less than high school education. Medical records were manually reviewed for all subjects with positive polymerase chain reaction test results to correctly identify symptomatic patients and then classify those subjects using the National Institutes of Health severity of illness categories. Classification was based on the highest severity of illness throughout gestation and not necessarily at the time of presentation for delivery. RESULTS: A total of 4873 patients were included in the study. The polymerase chain reaction test positivity rate was 11% (n=544). Among this group, 359 patients (66%) were asymptomatic or presymptomatic, 115 (21%) had mild or moderate coronavirus disease 2019, and 70 (13%) had severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019. On multiple logistic regression modeling, pregnant patients who had a positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were more likely to be younger or of higher parity, belong to minoritized racial and ethnic groups, have public health insurance, have limited English proficiency, and reside in low-income neighborhoods with less educational attainment. On ordinal logit regression modeling, obesity, income and education were associated with coronavirus disease 2019 severity. CONCLUSION: Social and physical determinants of health play a role in determining the risk of infection. The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 illness was not associated with race or ethnicity but was associated with maternal obesity and neighborhood level characteristics such as educational attainment and household income.",Prasannan L, S,Journal Article," BACKGROUND: The social and physical<br>environments in which people live affect the emergence,<br>prevalence, and severity of both infectious and<br>noninfectious diseases.

319,33754534,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has affected both adults and children with variable presentations and disease severity. Children can present with mild symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath, and rapidly progress to severe pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation. This population includes children who are younger than one year and older adolescents who have an underlying comorbidity-specifically immunosuppression or prior cardio-respiratory infections. In this review, we discuss the determinants of severe disease among the paediatric patients- primarily asthma, immune-status, obesity and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Asthma and underlying lung pathologies can be a strong predictor (~20% prevalence) for development of severe COVID-19 infection, irrespective of age. However, as compared to asthma, a higher mortality rate was reported in immune-compromised patients. With a weakened immune system, immunosuppressed individuals were 1.55 times and immunocompromised patients 3.29 times more vulnerable to developing severer COVID-19 disease. Similarly, evidence suggests that a BMI of greater than 35 kg/m2 renders individuals more susceptible to developing COVID-19-related complications. This observation is based on the negative impacts obesity has on pulmonary functions and in downplaying the immune system. Furthermore, a possible association of COVID-19 and MIS-C has been reported by multiple studies across the globe but it needs further studies to strengthen its stance due to the scarcity of data when compared with the other determinants discussed in this article. Authors recommend researchers directing attention on synthesizing the evolving evidence to fill the knowledge void in the paediatric population, which will better enable paediatricians to make informed decisions.","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has affected both adults and children with variable presentations and disease severity.

320,33746594,"Aim: In other respiratory infectious diseases, obesity may be associated with a poor outcome. For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the association between obesity and severity or prognosis requires further analysis. Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center study. Hospitalized patients were recruited in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 2, 2020 to February 20, 2020. The data of body mass index (BMI) was obtained from follow-up of surviving patients. According to BMI, normal weight was defined as 18.5-23.9 kg/m(2), overweight as 24.0-27.9 kg/m(2) and obesity as > 28.0 kg/m(2). Results: A total of 463 patients were enrolled, of which 242 (52.3%) patients were in the normal weight group; 179 (38.7%) were in the overweight group; and 42 (9.1%) were in the obesity group. Compared to the normal group, obese patients were more likely to have a higher heart rate; lower finger oxygen saturation; higher levels of white blood cells, neutrophil counts, basophil counts, intravenous glucose, triacylglycerol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase-MB, CD19+ cell counts and percentage; and lower levels of monocyte percentage, high density lipoprotein and CD3+ cell percentage. In addition, the proportions of hypertension (21.5% vs. 42.6%) and severe+critical illness (47.8 vs. 81.0 %) were significantly higher in the obesity group than those in normal group. However, no significant differences were observed between the normal and obesity groups in critical illness, organ damage and defined endpoint (mechanical ventilation or intensive care unit). Multiple logistic regression showed that obesity increased the risk of developing severe+critical illness (Odd ratio 3.586, 95% CI 1.550-8.298, P=0.003) in patients with COVID-19, and did not affect the risk of critical illness, organ damage and endpoints.

We analyzed a cohort of patients with cancer and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) reported to the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) to identify prognostic clinical factors, including laboratory measurements and anticancer therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with active or historical cancer and a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis recorded between 17 March and 18 November 2020 were included. The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity measured on an ordinal scale (uncomplicated, hospitalized, admitted to intensive care unit, mechanically ventilated, died within 30 days). Multivariable regression models included demographics, cancer status, anticancer therapy and timing, COVID-19-directed therapies, and laboratory measurements (among hospitalized patients). RESULTS: A total of 4966 patients were included (median age 66 years, 51% female, 50% non-Hispanic white); 2872 (58%) were hospitalized and 695 (14%) died; 61% had cancer that was present, diagnosed, or treated within the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Older age, male sex, obesity, cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, non-Hispanic black race, Hispanic ethnicity, worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, and hematologic malignancy were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Among hospitalized patients, low or high absolute lymphocyte count; high absolute neutrophil count; low platelet count; abnormal creatinine; troponin; lactate dehydrogenase; and C-reactive protein were associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Patients diagnosed early in the COVID-19 pandemic (January-April 2020) had worse outcomes than those diagnosed later. Specific anticancer therapies (e.g. R-CHOP, platinum combined with etoposide, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors) were associated with high 30-day all-cause mortality.

322,33744894,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading all over the world, particularly in developed countries where obesity is also widespread. There is a high frequency of increased BMI in patients admitted to intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 infection with a major severity in patients with an excess of visceral adiposity. Patients at risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory syndrome are characterised by the high prevalence of pre-existing diseases (high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer), most of them typically present in severely obese patients. Indeed, the biological role of adipose tissue in sustaining SARS-CoV-2 infection is not completely elucidated. SUMMARY: The forced isolation due to pandemic containment measures abruptly interrupted the rehabilitation programs to which many patients with severe obesity were enrolled. People affected by obesity, and especially those with severe obesity, should continue clinical rehabilitation programs, taking extra measures to avoid COVID-19 infection and reinforcing the adoption of preventive procedures. In this review, the available data on obesity and COVID-19 are discussed along with evidence-based strategies for maintaining the necessary continuous rehabilitation programs. Key Messages: Greater attention is needed for obese and severely obese patients in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which represents a huge challenge for both patients and healthcare professionals. The adoption of new strategies to guarantee adequate and continuous multidisciplinary nutritional rehabilitation programs will be crucial to control the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk populations as well as the worsening of obesity-linked complications.

323,33717716,"Background Obesity can be associated with one or more co-morbidities that worsen the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Studies demonstrated that severe forms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have occurred in elderly patients and patients with co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Objective This study investigated the impact of obesity on COVID-19 severity, irrespective of other individual factors. Methods This retrospective observational study included all adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, who were admitted to Sheikh Khalifa Ibn Zaid International University Hospital between March 20 and May 10, 2020. First, we compared patients with and those without obesity in terms of demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, clinical symptoms, and outcomes. Further, using logistic regression models, we analyzed the association between obesity and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Also, we examined whether the association between obesity and ICU admission was also consistent among overweight patients. Results The study population included 107 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Obese patients have been admitted in ICU more than patients without obesity (P-value = 0.035). While adjusting for other risk factors for ICU admission, we found that obesity was an independent risk factor for ICU admission (OR = 5.04, 95% CI (1.14-22.37)). When we examined the association of both obesity and overweight with ICU admission, we found that only obesity was significantly associated with ICU admission (OR = 9.11, 95% CI (1.49-55.84)). Conclusion Our study found that obesity was strongly associated with severity of COVID-19. The risk of ICU admission is greater in the presence of obesity.

325,33694267,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess whether diabetes mellitus (DM) or obesity is an independent risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes and to explore whether the risk conferred by one condition is modified by the other. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of inpatient adults with COVID-19 used multivariable Cox regression to determine the independent effects of DM and obesity on the composite outcome of intubation, intensive care unit admission, or in-hospital mortality. Effect modification between DM and obesity was assessed with a statistical interaction term and an exploration of stratum-specific effects. RESULTS: Out of 3,533 patients, a total of 1,134 (32%) had DM, 1,256 (36%) had obesity, and 430 (12%) had both. DM and obesity were independently associated with the composite outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14 [95% CI: 1.01-1.30] and HR 1.22 [95% CI: 1.05-1.43], respectively). A statistical trend for potential interaction between DM and obesity was observed (P = 0.20). Stratified analyses showed potential increased risk with obesity compared with normal weight among patients with DM (HR 1.34 [95% CI: 1.04-1.74]) and patients without DM (HR 1.18 [95% CI: 0.96-1.43]). CONCLUSIONS: DM and obesity are independent risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity. Stratified analyses suggest that obesity may confer greater risk to patients with DM compared with patients without DM, and this relationship requires further exploration.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess whether diabetes mellitus (DM) or obesity is an independent risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes and to explore whether the risk conferred by one condition is modified by the other.

326,33692174,"INTRODUCTION: Risk factors of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 are defined but stratification of mortality using non-laboratory measured scores, particularly at the time of prehospital SARS-CoV-2 testing, is lacking. METHODS: Multivariate regression with bootstrapping was used to identify independent mortality predictors in patients admitted to an acute hospital with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Predictions were externally validated in a large random sample of the ISARIC cohort (N=14 231) and a smaller cohort from Aintree (N=290). RESULTS: 983 patients (median age 70, IQR 53-83; in-hospital mortality 29.9%) were recruited over an 11-week study period. Through sequential modelling, a five-predictor score termed SOARS (SpO2, Obesity, Age, Respiratory rate, Stroke history) was developed to correlate COVID-19 severity across low, moderate and high strata of mortality risk. The score discriminated well for in-hospital death, with area under the receiver operating characteristic values of 0.82, 0.80 and 0.74 in the derivation, Aintree and ISARIC validation cohorts, respectively. Its predictive accuracy (calibration) in both external cohorts was consistently higher in patients with milder disease (SOARS 0-1), the same individuals who could be identified for safe outpatient monitoring. Prediction of a non-fatal outcome in this group was accompanied by high score sensitivity (99.2%) and negative predictive value (95.9%). CONCLUSION: The SOARS score uses constitutive and readily assessed individual characteristics to predict the risk of COVID-19 death. Deployment of the score could potentially inform clinical triage in preadmission settings where expedient and reliable decision-making is key. The resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission provides an opportunity to further validate and update its performance.","INTRODUCTION: Risk factors of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 are defined but stratification of mortality using non-laboratory measured scores, particularly at the time of prehospital SARS-CoV-2 testing, is lacking.

Male sex, advanced age, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity have been identified as risk factors for the COVID-19 severity. Presumably, as these three cardiovascular risk factors are associated with a high prevalence of multiorgan damage. In the present focused clinical review, we will discuss the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 including acute cardiovascular syndrome (acute cardiac injury/COVID cardiomyopathy, thromboembolic complications and arrhythmias) and post-COVID-19 sequelae. Preliminary data shows that the cause of acute cardiovascular syndrome may be multifactorial and involve direct viral invasion of the heart and vascular system, as well as through the immune and inflammation-mediated systemic cytokine storm. COVID-19 survivors may also show persistently elevated blood pressure and sinus tachycardia at rest. Furthermore, poor diabetic control, persistent renal damage and cerebral sequelae, such as persistent cognitive and neuropsychiatric alterations are also frequently reported. A particular attention should be paid towards cardiovascular protection in COVID-19 patients who develop acute cardiovascular syndromes during hospitalization, and/or permanent/semipermanent sequelae after recovery from COVID-19. These conditions may require careful clinical assessment, treatment and close follow-up to avoid short-term and long-term complications.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may cause not only an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but also multiple organ damage and failure requiring intensive care and leading to death.

Hypertension has been identified as one of the most common comorbidities and risk factors for severity and adverse outcome in these patients. Recent investigations have raised the question whether hypertension represents a predictor of outcome in COVID-19 patients independently of other common comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, other cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney, liver, and pulmonary diseases. However, the impact of chronic and newly diagnosed hypertension in COVID-19 patients has been insufficiently investigated. The same is true for the relationship between blood pressure levels and outcomes in COVID-19 patients. It seems that the long discussion about the impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and blockers of angiotensin I receptors (ARB) on severity and outcome in COVID-19 is approaching an end because the large number of original studies and meta-analyses discarded the initial findings about higher prevalence of ACEI/ARB use in patients with unfavorable outcomes. Nevertheless, there are many controversies in the relationship between hypertension and COVID-19. The aim of this review article is to provide a clinical overview of the currently available evidence regarding the predictive value of hypertension, the effect of blood pressure levels, the impact of previously known and newly diagnosed hypertension, and the effect of antihypertensive therapy on the severity and outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic responsible for millions of deaths around the world.

329,33669276,"Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) can develop into a severe respiratory syndrome that results in up to 40% mortality. Acute lung inflammatory edema is a major pathological finding in autopsies explaining O2 diffusion failure and hypoxemia. Only dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in severe cases, further supporting a role for inflammation in disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells employing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, which is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells. ACE2 is one of the components of the cellular machinery that inactivates the potent inflammatory agent bradykinin, and SARS-CoV-2 infection could interfere with the catalytic activity of ACE2, leading to the accumulation of bradykinin. Methods: In this case control study, we tested two pharmacological inhibitors of the kinin-kallikrein system that are currently approved for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, icatibant, and inhibitor of C1 esterase/kallikrein, in a group of 30 patients with severe COVID-19. Results: Neither icatibant nor inhibitor of C1 esterase/kallikrein resulted in changes in time to clinical improvement. However, both compounds were safe and promoted the significant improvement of lung computed tomography scores and increased blood eosinophils, which are indicators of disease recovery. Conclusions: In this small cohort, we found evidence for safety and a beneficial role of pharmacological inhibition of the kinin-kallikrein system in two markers that indicate improved disease recovery.","Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) can develop into a severe respiratory syndrome that results in up to 40% mortality.

Using data from the UK Biobank, we investigated the relationship between severity of COVID-19 and metabolic syndrome-related serum biomarkers measured prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Logistic regression analyses were used to test biomarker levels and biomarker-associated genetic variants with SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive cases and negative controls, a 10 mg/dl increase in serum HDL-cholesterol or apolipoprotein A1 levels was associated with approximately 10% reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, after adjustment for age, sex, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Evaluation of known genetic variants for HDL-cholesterol revealed that individuals homozygous for apolipoprotein E4 alleles had approximately 2- to 3-fold higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or mortality from COVID-19 compared with apolipoprotein E3 homozygotes, even after adjustment for HDL-cholesterol levels. However, cumulative effects of all evaluated HDL-cholesterol-raising alleles and Mendelian randomization analyses did not reveal association of genetically higher HDL-cholesterol levels with decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

332,33661992,"AIM: COVID-19 clinical presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severe cases. While there are a number of early publications relating to risk factors for COVID-19 infection, low sample size and heterogeneity in study design impacted consolidation of early findings. There is a pressing need to identify the factors which predispose patients to severe cases of COVID-19. For rapid and widespread risk stratification, these factors should be easily obtainable, inexpensive, and avoid invasive clinical procedures. The aim of our study is to fill this knowledge gap by systematically mapping all the available evidence on the association of various clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables with the risk of specific adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The systematic review was conducted using standardized methodology, searching two electronic databases (PubMed and SCOPUS) for relevant literature published between 1st January 2020 and 9th July 2020. Included studies reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 while reporting outcomes relating to disease severity. In the case of sufficient comparable data, meta-analyses were conducted to estimate risk of each variable. RESULTS: Seventy-six studies were identified, with a total of 17,860,001 patients across 14 countries. The studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of the sample under study, outcomes, and risk measures reported. A large number of risk factors were presented for COVID-19. Commonly reported variables for adverse outcome from COVID-19 comprised patient characteristics, including age >75 (OR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.81-3.90), male sex (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.39-3.04) and severe obesity (OR: 2.57, 95% CI: 1.31-5.05). Active cancer (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.04-2.04) was associated with increased risk of severe outcome. A number of common symptoms and vital measures (respiratory rate and SpO2) also suggested elevated risk profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this study, a range of easily assessed parameters are valuable to predict elevated risk of severe illness and mortality as a result of COVID-19, including patient characteristics and detailed comorbidities, alongside the novel inclusion of real-time symptoms and vital measurements.","AIM: COVID-19 clinical presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severe cases.

333,33661905,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies report associations of diverse cardiometabolic conditions including obesity with COVID-19 illness, but causality has not been established. We sought to evaluate the associations of 17 cardiometabolic traits with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We selected genetic variants associated with each exposure, including body mass index (BMI), at p < 5 x 10-8 from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We then calculated inverse-variance-weighted averages of variant-specific estimates using summary statistics for susceptibility and severity from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS meta-analyses of population-based cohorts and hospital registries comprising individuals with self-reported or genetically inferred European ancestry. Susceptibility was defined as testing positive for COVID-19 and severity was defined as hospitalization with COVID-19 versus population controls (anyone not a case in contributing cohorts). We repeated the analysis for BMI with effect estimates from the UK Biobank and performed pairwise multivariable MR to estimate the direct effects and indirect effects of BMI through obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases. Using p < 0.05/34 tests = 0.0015 to declare statistical significance, we found a nonsignificant association of genetically higher BMI with testing positive for COVID-19 (14,134 COVID-19 cases/1,284,876 controls, p = 0.002; UK Biobank: odds ratio 1.06 [95% CI 1.02, 1.10] per kg/m2; p = 0.004]) and a statistically significant association with higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (6,406 hospitalized COVID-19 cases/902,088 controls, p = 4.3 x 10-5; UK Biobank: odds ratio 1.14 [95% CI 1.07, 1.21] per kg/m2, p = 2.1 x 10-5). The implied direct effect of BMI was abolished upon conditioning on the effect on type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. No other cardiometabolic exposures tested were associated with a higher risk of poorer COVID-19 outcomes. Small study samples and weak genetic instruments could have limited the detection of modest associations, and pleiotropy may have biased effect estimates away from the null. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found genetic evidence to support higher BMI as a causal risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. These results raise the possibility that obesity could amplify COVID-19 disease burden independently or through its cardiometabolic consequences and suggest that targeting obesity may be a strategy to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.","BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies report associations of diverse cardiometabolic conditions including obesity with COVID-19 illness, but causality has not been established.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1249 patients with COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Predictors of ACI and AKI were investigated. Multivariable-logistic regression models were used to determine the association of ACI (or AKI) with severity and mortality. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 36 years and 61.9% were male. ACI and AKI were observed in 53 (4.2%) and 91 (7.3%) of patients, respectively. Patients with age > 60 years, chronic heart disease, decreased lymphocyte and increased CRP, PCT, and ESR on hospital admission, and Lopinavir/Ritonavir use showed higher odds of ACI.

337,33653666,"BACKGROUND: Although recent studies have shown an association between obesity and adverse coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient outcomes, there is a paucity in large studies focusing on hospitalized patients. We aimed to analyze outcomes associated with obesity in a large cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study at a tertiary care health system of adult patients with COVID-19 who were admitted between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Patients were stratified by body mass index (BMI) into obese (BMI >/= 30 kg/m 2) and non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m 2) cohorts. Primary outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, and 30-day readmission. RESULTS: A total of 1983 patients were included of whom 1031 (51.9%) had obesity and 952 (48.9%) did not have obesity. Patients with obesity were younger (P < 0.001), more likely to be female (P < 0.001) and African American (P < 0.001) compared to patients without obesity. Multivariable logistic models adjusting for differences in age, sex, race, medical comorbidities, and treatment modalities revealed no difference in 60-day mortality and 30-day readmission between obese and non-obese groups. In these models, patients with obesity had increased odds of ICU admission (adjusted OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07-1.76; P = 0.012) and intubation (adjusted OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.04-1.80; P = 0.026).

339,33647501,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: As of January 2021, over 88 million people have been infected with COVID-19. Almost two million people have died of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A high SOFA score and a D-Dimer >1 microg/mL identifies patients with high risk of mortality. High lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels on admission are associated with severity and mortality. Different degrees of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) abnormalities have been reported in these patients, its association with a mortality risk remains controversial. The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between LDH and in-hospital mortality in Mexican patients admitted with COVID-19. MATERIALS & METHODS: We performed a retrospective multi-centre cohort study with 377 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in three centres in Mexico City, Mexico, who were >/=18 years old and died or were discharged between April 1 and May 31, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 377 patients were evaluated, 298 (79.1%) patients were discharged, and 79 (20.9%) patients died during hospitalization. Non-survivors were older, with a median age of 46.7 +/- 25.7 years old, most patients were male. An ALT > 61 U/l (OR 3.45, 95% CI 1.27-9.37; p = 0.015), C-reactive protein (CRP) > 231 mg/l (OR 4.71, 95% CI 2.35-9.46; p = 0.000), LDH > 561 U/l (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.40-6.55; p = 0.005) were associated with higher odds for in-hospital death.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched and all studies conducted on COVID-19 and obesity were reviewed. All studies were independently screened by reviewers based on their titles and abstracts. RESULTS: Forty relevant articles were selected, and their full texts were reviewed. Obesity affects the respiratory and immune systems through various mechanisms. Cytokine and adipokine secretion from adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state in obese patients, predisposing them to thrombosis, incoordination of innate and adaptive immune responses, inadequate antibody response, and cytokine storm. Obese patients had a longer virus shedding. Obesity is associated with other comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and vitamin D deficiency. Hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and even mortality in obese patients were higher than normal-weight patients. Obesity could alter the direction of severe COVID-19 symptoms to younger individuals. Reduced physical activity, unhealthy eating habits and, more stress and fear experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic may result in more weight gain and obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity should be considered as an independent risk factor for the severity of COVID-19. Paying more attention to preventing weight gain in obese patients with COVID-19 infection in early levels of disease is crucial during this pandemic.","BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that obesity is associated with the severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

341,33637950,"COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by a coronavirus, designed as SARS CoV-2, whose clinical presentation is widely variable, with most patients having mild or no symptoms, but others developing a malign disease with multi-organ failure and even death. Accumulating data from different populations have shown that obesity is a risk factor for a severe evolution of the disease, however, the mechanisms that explain this association are not clearly understood. An ominous evolution of COVID-19 has been attributed to an exacerbated inflammatory response, designed as ""cytokine storm"" with augmented production of cytokines/chemokines through the activation of toll-like receptors (TLR) by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, that triggers an inflammatory downstream response, mediated in part by the adaptor molecule, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88). Previous studies have reported an increased expression of MyD88 and TLRs in people with obesity, mainly in those with metabolic complications. Therefore, we hypothesize, that an underlying increased Myd88/TLR signaling may predispose to patients with obesity to develop an exaggerated and dangerous inflammatory reaction against SARS CoV-2 infection, explaining at least in part, the higher severity of COVID-19. In addition, MyD88/TLR signaling in people with obesity could have a role in the development of several chronic diseases.","COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by a coronavirus, designed as SARS CoV-2, whose clinical presentation is widely variable, with most patients having mild or no symptoms, but others developing a malign disease with multi-organ failure and even death.

342,33631142,"OBJECTIVES: Recent studies suggested obesity to be a possible risk factor for COVID-19 disease in the wake of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. However, the causality and especially the role of body fat distribution in this context is still unclear. Thus, using a univariable as well as multivariable two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we investigated for the first time the causal impact of body composition on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. METHODS: As indicators of overall and abdominal obesity we considered the measures body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and trunk fat ratio (TFR). Summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for these body composition measures were drawn from the GIANT consortium and UK Biobank, while for susceptibility and severity due to COVID-19 disease data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative was used. For the COVID-19 cohort neither age nor gender was available. Total and direct causal effect estimates were calculated using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), sensitivity analyses were done applying several robust MR techniques and mediation effects of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were investigated within multivariable MR analyses. RESULTS: Genetically predicted BMI was strongly associated with both, susceptibility (OR=1.31 per 1 SD increase; 95% CI: 1.15-1.50; P-value=7.3.10(-5)) and hospitalization (OR=1.62 per 1 SD increase; 95% CI: 1.33-1.99; P-value=2.8.10(-6)) even after adjustment for genetically predicted visceral obesity traits. These associations were neither mediated substantially by T2D nor by CVD. Finally, total but not direct effects of visceral body fat on outcomes could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides strong evidence for a causal impact of overall obesity on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 disease. The impact of abdominal obesity was weaker and disappeared after adjustment for BMI. Therefore, obese people should be regarded as a high-risk group.

343,33627147,"IMPORTANCE: Active pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia and MIS-C are two disease processes requiring rapid diagnosis and different treatment protocols. OBJECTIVE: To distinguish active pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia and MIS-C using presenting signs and symptoms, patient characteristics, and laboratory values. DESIGN: Patients diagnosed and hospitalized with active COVID-19 pneumonia or MIS-C at Children's of Alabama Hospital in Birmingham, AL from April 1 through September 1, 2020 were identified retrospectively. Active COVID-19 and MIS-C cases were defined using diagnostic codes and verified for accuracy using current US Centers for Disease Control case definitions. All clinical notes were reviewed for documentation of COVID-19 pneumonia or MIS-C, and clinical notes and electronic medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, presenting signs and symptoms, prior exposure to or testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, laboratory data, imaging, treatment modalities and response to treatment. FINDINGS: 111 patients were identified, with 74 classified as mild COVID-19, 8 patients as moderate COVID-19, 8 patients as severe COVID-19, 10 as mild MIS-C and 11 as severe MIS-C. All groups had a male predominance, with Black and Hispanic patients overrepresented as compared to the demographics of Alabama. Most MIS-C patients were healthy at baseline, with most COVID-19 patients having at least one underlying illness. Fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms were predominant in the MIS-C population whereas COVID-19 patients presented with predominantly respiratory symptoms. The two groups were similar in duration of symptomatic prodrome and exposure history to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but MIS-C patients had a longer duration between presentation and exposure history. COVID-19 patients were more likely to have a positive SAR-CoV-2 PCR and to require respiratory support on admission. MIS-C patients had lower sodium levels, higher levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, d-dimer and procalcitonin. COVID-19 patients had higher lactate dehydrogenase levels on admission. MIS-C patients had coronary artery changes on echocardiography more often than COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study is one of the first to directly compare COVID-19 and MIS-C in the pediatric population. The significant differences found between symptoms at presentation, demographics, and laboratory findings will aide health-care providers in distinguishing the two disease entities.","IMPORTANCE: Active pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia and MIS-C are two disease processes requiring rapid diagnosis and different treatment protocols.

345,33622834,"INTRODUCTION: To date, there are no effective treatments for decreasing hospitalizations in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections. It has been suggested that the influenza vaccine might attenuate the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective single-centered cohort review of a de-identified database of 2005 patients over the age of 18 within the University of Florida health care system who tested positive for COVID-19. Comorbidities and influenza vaccination status were examined. The primary outcome was severity of disease as reflected by hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between influenza status and hospitalization. RESULTS: COVID-19-positive patients who had not received the influenza vaccination within the last year had a 2.44 (95% CI, 1.68, 3.61) greater odds of hospitalization and a 3.29 (95% CI, 1.18, 13.77) greater odds of ICU admission when compared with those who were vaccinated. These results were controlled to account for age, race, gender, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. DISCUSSION: Our analysis suggests that the influenza vaccination is potentially protective of moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 infection. This protective effect holds regardless of comorbidity. The literature points to a potential mechanism via natural killer cell activation. Though our data potentially is limited by its generalizability and our vaccination rate is low, it holds significant relevance given the upcoming influenza season. Not only could simply encouraging influenza vaccination decrease morbidity and mortality from the flu, but it might help flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic as well. We encourage further studies into this finding.","INTRODUCTION: To date, there are no effective treatments for decreasing hospitalizations in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections.

346,33621211,"Comorbid medical illnesses, such as obesity and diabetes, are associated with more severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death. However, the role of the immune system in mediating these clinical outcomes has not been determined. We used multiparameter flow cytometry and systems serology to comprehensively profile the functions of T cells and antibodies targeting spike, nucleocapsid, and envelope proteins in a convalescent cohort of COVID-19 subjects who were either hospitalized (n = 20) or not hospitalized (n = 40). To avoid confounding, subjects were matched by age, sex, ethnicity, and date of symptom onset. Surprisingly, we found that the magnitude and functional breadth of virus-specific CD4+ T cell and antibody responses were consistently higher among hospitalized subjects, particularly those with medical comorbidities. However, an integrated analysis identified more coordination between polyfunctional CD4+ T cells and antibodies targeting the S1 domain of spike among subjects who were not hospitalized. These data reveal a functionally diverse and coordinated response between T cells and antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2, which is reduced in the presence of comorbid illnesses that are known risk factors for severe COVID-19.","Comorbid medical illnesses, such as obesity and diabetes, are associated with more severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death.

348,33599721,"PURPOSE: To evaluate whether use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a reduced likelihood of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the early weeks of the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted to determine selected treatment outcomes in 336 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at an acute care community hospital in the Hudson Valley region of New York from March 20 to April 20, 2020. Eligibility included admission to the hospital, a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and no need for intubation or intensive care at admission. The median (interquartile range) ages of patients who received hydroxychloroquine (n = 188) and those who did not (n = 148) were 68 (58-82) and 64 (51-73) years, respectively. In a multivariable model that included age, gender, obesity, diabetes, and hydroxychloroquine use, patients who received hydroxychloroquine were significantly more likely than those not treated with the drug to be transferred to an ICU (odds ratio, [OR], 8.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.8-17) and significantly more likely to be intubated (OR, 7.99; 95% CI, 3.76-16.91); these associations were not influenced by disease severity. In-hospital mortality did not differ significantly with disease severity between those who did and those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine use was significantly associated with increased risks of ICU admission and intubation in patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID-19. There were no significant between-group differences in mortality with use vs nonuse of hydroxychloroquine.","PURPOSE: To evaluate whether use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with a reduced likelihood of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the early weeks of the pandemic.

349,33597204,"Obesity has caused wide concerns due to its high prevalence in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Coexistence of diabetes and obesity could cause an even higher risk of severe outcomes due to immunity dysfunction. We conducted a retrospective study in 1,637 adult patients who were admitted into an acute hospital in Wuhan, China. Propensity score-matched logistic regression was used to estimate the risks of severe pneumonia and requiring in-hospital oxygen therapy associated with obesity. After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities, obesity was significantly associated with higher odds of severe pneumonia (odds ratio [OR] 1.47 [95% CI 1.15-1.88]; P = 0.002) and oxygen therapy (OR 1.40 [95% CI 1.10-1.79]; P = 0.007). Higher ORs of severe pneumonia due to obesity were observed in men, older adults, and those with diabetes. Among patients with diabetes, overweight increased the odds of requiring in-hospital oxygen therapy by 0.68 times (P = 0.014) and obesity increased the odds by 1.06 times (P = 0.028). A linear dose-response curve between BMI and severe outcomes was observed in all patients, whereas a U-shaped curve was observed in those with diabetes. Our findings provide important evidence to support obesity as an independent risk factor for severe outcomes of COVID-19 infection in the early phase of the ongoing pandemic.","Obesity has caused wide concerns due to its high prevalence in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

350,33595720,"The current review critically analyzes obesity as an important risk factor for increased predisposition towards coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its severity and causal death in current pandemic. Countries with higher prevalence of exposed obese individuals experienced the highest number of mortalities.

Therefore, obese individuals are worse in condition because of a higher presence of adiposity increases the number of ACE2 expressing cells. Furthermore, in silico interactions of ACE2 and different variants of coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) spike S1 protein suggest that mutant strains are more infectious than wildtype as they bind to host ACE2 protein with high binding affinities.

351,33592042,"OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worst pandemic. The clinical characteristics vary from asymptomatic to fatal. This study aims to examine the association between body mass index (BMI) levels and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A cohort study included 147 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 were categorized into 4 groups by BMI levels on admission: <18.5 (underweight), 18.5-22.9 (normal weight), 23.0-24.9 (overweight), and >/=25.0 kg/m2 (obese). Rates of pneumonia, severe pneumonia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and ICU stay during hospitalization across BMI group was determined. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between BMI and severe pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the totals, patients having a BMI <18.5, 18.5-22.9, 23.0-24.9, and >/=25.0 kg/m2 were 12.9%, 38.1%, 17.7%, and 31.3%, respectively. The rates of pneumonia and severe pneumonia tended to be higher in patients with higher BMI, whereas the rates of AKI and ICU stay were higher in patients with BMI <18.5 kg/m2 and >/= 25 kg/m2, when compared to patients with normal BMI. After controlling for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia in the logistic regression analysis, having a BMI >/=25.0 kg/m2 was associated with higher risk of severe pneumonia (OR 4.73; 95% CI, 1.50-14.94; p = 0.003) compared to having a BMI 18.5-22.9 kg/m2. During admission, elevated hemoglobin and alanine aminotransferase levels on day 7 and 14 of illness were associated with higher BMI levels.

352,33587365,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This manuscript reviews evidence collected during COVID-19 pandemic and provides information on the impact of body composition on severity and outcomes of the disease, analysing methods used for body composition assessment. Malnutrition-screening tools will also be discussed to screen and diagnose the patients at higher risk of COVID-19 severity and related worse outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 can occur in a wide range of presentation, from asymptomatic to severe forms. Among the major risk factors for worse severity, overnutrition, undernutrition and body composition play a role in the ability to respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Excess fat accumulation (i.e. obesity) or lean mass loss and functionality (i.e. sarcopenia) or a combination of both (i.e. sarcopenic obesity) can affect whole-body functioning. These body composition alterations in the short-term can influence susceptibility and immunological responses to the virus, inflammatory reaction, metabolic and respiratory distress, while in the long-term can modulate disease outcomes, namely length of stay, time required for recovery, risk of ICU-acquired weakness and long-term disabilities, and potentially increase the risk of death. SUMMARY: Individuals with malnutrition, sarcopenia, obesity, sarcopenic obesity and older adults with abnormal body composition or malnutrition risk may require tailored medical nutrition therapy to improve short and long-term COVID-19 outcomes.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This manuscript reviews evidence collected during COVID-19 pandemic and provides information on the impact of body composition on severity and outcomes of the disease, analysing methods used for body composition assessment.

Among the major risk factors for worse severity, overnutrition, undernutrition and body composition play a role in the ability to respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Excess fat accumulation (i.e. obesity) or lean mass loss and functionality (i.e. sarcopenia) or a combination of both (i.e. sarcopenic obesity) can affect whole-body functioning. These body composition alterations in the short-term can influence susceptibility and immunological responses to the virus, inflammatory reaction, metabolic and respiratory distress, while in the long-term can modulate disease outcomes, namely length of stay, time required for recovery, risk of ICU-acquired weakness and long-term disabilities, and potentially increase the risk of death.

Furthermore, people with hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and other related complications like cardiovascular and kidney diseases have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection than the general population and usually exhibit poor prognosis. This severity could be due to systemic inflammation and compromised immune response and RAS associated with these comorbid conditions.

We performed a longitudinal evaluation of the disease course of smokers, former smokers, and COPD patients with COVID-19 without other comorbidities, from hospitalization to hospital discharge. Although no difference between groups was observed during hospital admission, smokers and COPD patients presented an increase in COVID-19-associated inflammatory markers during the disease course in comparison to non-smokers and former smokers.

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is disease severity measures and risk factors are associated with admission to an intensive care unit and mortality? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were extracted from the COVID-19 database of the Integrated Argentina Health Information System, encompassing the period of March 3rd to October 2nd, 2020, using a standardized case report form that included information on contact history, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical diagnosis. Information was collected at the initial site of care and follow-up conducted through calls by the regional healthcare authorities. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as having a positive result through sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. RESULTS: RT-PCR testing was positive in 738,776 cases. Complete datasets were available for analysis in 207,079 cases. Mean age was 42.9+/-18.8 years, 50.0% were males. Frequent co-existing conditions included hypertension (19.2%), diabetes (9.7%), asthma (6.1%) and obesity (5.2%). Most common symptoms included fever (58.5%), cough (58.0%), headache (45.4%), and sore throat (42.1%). Death or ICU admission were independently associated with older age, male, coma, dyspnea or tachypnea, and seizures, with underlying co-morbidities such as immunodeficiency, chronic renal failure, and liver disease showing the strongest effects. INTERPRETATION: Most cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Argentina were mild and had a favorable outcome, but fatality rates were relatively elevated. Risk factors for adverse outcome included older age, male sex, coma and seizures, and the concurrent presence of several morbidities.

358,33550984,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 strain, was first identified in late 2019 in China. The outcomes of patients affected by the virus can worsen, developing acute respiratory failure and other serious complications, especially in older individuals and people with obesity and comorbidities. Thus, obese patients tend to have a more severe course of COVID-19. Thus, this review aims to synthesize the evidence in the literature that associates COVID-19 and the severity of clinical outcomes in infected obese patients. METHODS: This protocol was designed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols Statement. Scientific and gray literature will be systematically selected from PubMed/MEDLINE, Latin American Literature in Health Sciences, Online Scientific Electronic Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane. The selection of articles will be limited to studies published in English, Portuguese, and Spanish from December 2019 onwards. The main clinical outcomes will be clinical severity in obese patients with COVID-19 as tachypnea (respiratory rate, >/= 30 breaths per minute), hypoxemia (oxygen saturation, </= 93%), the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (< 300), lung infiltrate (> 50% of the lung field involved within 24-48 h), diagnosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, need of invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. Selection bias will be minimized by excluding studies published before December 2019. Conflicts will be resolved through a third reviewer and consensus-building. Moreover, findings will be reported using narrative synthesis and tabulation of the summaries. DISCUSSION: Given the need for early detection of the possible implications and treatment for patients with obesity diagnosed with COVID-19, the scoping review will be useful to capture the state of the current literature, identify the gaps, and make recommendations for future research for directing the conduct and optimization of therapies in these patients by the multiprofessional teams.

359,33549439,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent studies show that obesity is a risk factor for hospital admission and for critical care need in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim was to determine whether obesity is a risk factor for unfavourable health outcomes in patients affected by COVID-19 admitted to ICU. METHODS AND RESULTS: 95 consecutive patients with COVID-19 (78 males and 18 females) were admitted to ICU and included in the study. Height, weight, BMI, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, CRP, CPK, ICU and hospital length of stay and comorbidities were evaluated. Participants with obesity had a lower 28 day survival rate from ICU admission than normal weight subjects. Cox proportional hazard model-derived estimates, adjusted for age, gender and comorbidity, confirmed the results of the survival analysis (HR:5.30,95%C.I.1.26-22.34). Obese subjects showed longer hospital and ICU stay as compared with normal weight counterpart.Subjects with obesity showed significantly higher CRP and CPK levels than normal weight subjects. CONCLUSION: In individuals with obesity, careful management and prompt intervention in case of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection is necessary to prevent the progression of the disease towards severe outcomes and the increase of hospital treatment costs.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent studies show that obesity is a risk factor for hospital admission and for critical care need in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

361,33536004,"BACKGROUND: Lifestyle factors including obesity and smoking are suggested to be correlated with increased risk of COVID-19 severe illness or related death. However, whether these relationships are causal is not well known; neither for the relationships between COVID-19 severe illness and other common lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and alcohol consumption. METHODS: Genome-wide significant genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI), lifetime smoking, physical activity and alcohol consumption identified by large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of up to 941,280 individuals were selected as instrumental variables. Summary statistics of the genetic variants on severe illness of COVID-19 were obtained from GWAS analyses of up to 6492 cases and 1,012,809 controls. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Both per-standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted BMI and lifetime smoking were associated with about two-fold increased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 and COVID-19 hospitalization (all P < 0.05). Per-SD increase in genetically predicted physical activity was associated with decreased risks of severe respiratory COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05, 0.74; P = 0.02), but not with COVID-19 hospitalization (OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.18, 1.07; P = 0.07). No evidence of association was found for genetically predicted alcohol consumption. Similar results were found across robust Mendelian randomisation methods. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is found that BMI and smoking causally increase and physical activity might causally decrease the risk of COVID-19 severe illness.

362,33534813,"BACKGROUND: As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has remained in Latin America, Mexico has become the third country with the highest death rate worldwide. Data regarding in-hospital mortality and its risk factors, as well as the impact of hospital overcrowding in Latin America has not been thoroughly explored. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled consecutive adult patients hospitalized with severe confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia at a SARS-CoV-2 referral center in Mexico City from February 26th, 2020, to June 5th, 2020. A total of 800 patients were admitted with confirmed diagnosis, mean age was 51.9 +/- 13.9 years, 61% were males, 85% were either obese or overweight, 30% had hypertension and 26% type 2 diabetes. From those 800, 559 recovered (69.9%) and 241 died (30.1%). Among survivors, 101 (18%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 458 (82%) were managed outside the intensive care unit (ICU); mortality in the ICU was 49%. From the non-survivors, 45.6% (n = 110) did not receive full support due to lack of ICU bed availability. Within this subgroup the main cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 95% of the cases, whereas among the non-survivors who received full (n = 105) support the main cause of death was septic shock (45%) followed by ARDS (29%). The main risk factors associated with in-hospital death were male sex (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.34-3.12), obesity (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.14-2.32)-in particular morbid obesity (RR 3.38, 95%CI 1.63-7.00)-and oxygen saturation < 80% on admission (RR 4.8, 95%CI 3.26-7.31). CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found similar in-hospital and ICU mortality, as well as risk factors for mortality, compared to previous reports. However, 45% of the patients who did not survive justified admission to ICU but did not receive IMV / ICU care due to the unavailability of ICU beds. Furthermore, mortality rate over time was mainly due to the availability of ICU beds, indirectly suggesting that overcrowding was one of the main factors that contributed to hospital mortality.","BACKGROUND: As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has remained in Latin America, Mexico has become the third country with the highest death rate worldwide.

This study assessed the possible roles of metabolic/obesity phenotypes and vitamin D status in increasing the greater severity of COVID-19. We studied 353,299 UK Biobank participants from England with a mean age of 67.7 years. Metabolic/obesity phenotypes were defined as a combination of metabolic components (hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes) and obesity. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to test whether the addition of metabolic disorders and vitamin D insufficiency increased obesity associations with COVID-19 hospitalization, confirmed COVID-19, and severe COVID-19. Metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUHO) represented 12.3% of the total analytic samples, and 21.5%, 18.5%, and 19.8% of the included subpopulations with COVID-19 hospitalization, confirmed COVID-19, and severe COVID-19, respectively. Vitamin D insufficiency phenotypes represented 53.5% of the total analytic samples, and 59.5%, 61.7%, and 61.5% of the included subpopulations with COVID-19 hospitalization, confirmed COVID-19, and severe COVID-19, respectively. In multivariate logistic regression, MUHO and vitamin D insufficiency and their combination were significantly associated with COVID-19 illness severity (odds ratio [OR] for COVID-19 hospitalization = 2.33, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.02-2.70; OR for confirmed COVID-19 = 2.06, 95% CI, 1.58-2.70; OR for severe COVID-19 = 2.06, 95% CI, 1.47-2.87).

366,33519443,"The effect of immunosuppressant treatments on the incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains largely unknown. We studied the association between the pre-exposure to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that decrease immunological responses and the incidence of COVID-19 to explore the possible effects of these treatments in early manifestations of the disease. For this purpose, we performed a cross-sectional study including 2,494 patients with immunomediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) recruited at the outpatient Rheumatology, Dermatology and Gastroenterology services of Hospital del Mar. The primary outcome was the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 performed by a physician at the hospital or at the primary care center, from the March 1-29, 2020. Multivariable Poisson regression models were fitted to estimate COVID-19 relative risk (RR) adjusted by comorbidities. We revealed that biological (RR = 0.46, CI 95% = 0.31-0.67) and synthetic (RR = 0.62, CI 95% = 0.43-0.91) DMARDs used in IMIDs diminished the incidence of COVID-19. Striking sex differences were revealed with anti-TNFalpha compounds (RR = 0.50, CI 95% = 0.33-0.75) with higher effects in women (RR = 0.33, CI 95% = 0.17-0.647). Treatment with low glucocorticoid doses also revealed sex differences decreasing the incidence of COVID-19 predominantly in women (RR = 0.72, CI 95% = 0.42-1.22). Our results report a decreased incidence of COVID-19 in patients receiving specific DMARDs with different immunodepressor mechanisms with striking sex differences. These results underline the interest of repurposing specific DMARDs for the possibility of minimizing the severity of disease progression in the early stages of COVID-19.","The effect of immunosuppressant treatments on the incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains largely unknown.

367,33518528,"OBJECTIVES: To determine if obesity and diabetes are risk factors for severe outcomes in COVID-19 and to compare patient outcomes in those two conditions. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Urban tertiary care center in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: 302 patients admitted in an inpatient setting, >/=18 years old, with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 via nasal PCR swab were randomly selected. Patients were separated into two cohorts based on their body mass index and hemoglobin A1c. 150 patients were placed in the non-obese, non-diabetic cohort and 152 patients were placed in the corresponding cohort (obesity alone, obesity and diabetes, and diabetes alone). MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were development of acute kidney injury, commencement of renal replacement therapy, aminotransferase elevation, troponin elevation, lactic acidosis, development of septic shock, use of vasopressors, presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and intubation. The secondary outcomes were length of stay in days and mortality. RESULTS: Patients with obesity and/or diabetes were more likely to develop ARDS (79 patients vs 57 patients, p<0.0001) and to be intubated (71 patients vs 45 patients, p=0.0031). Patients with obesity and/or diabetes were more likely to require vasopressors (60 patients vs 41 patients, p=0.0284) and to develop lactic acidosis (median 3.15 mmol/L, IQR 1.8 to 5.2 mmol/L, p=0.0432). When comparing patients with diabetes with and without obesity against patients with obesity alone, they were more likely to develop ARDS (87.5%, p=0.0305). Despite these findings, there was no difference in mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, those with obesity and/or diabetes were more likely to suffer severe complications, but had negligible differences in mortality. This highlights the importance of close monitoring of patients with these conditions and additional areas of research needed to explain the mortality findings.","OBJECTIVES: To determine if obesity and diabetes are risk factors for severe outcomes in COVID-19 and to compare patient outcomes in those two conditions.

368,33516648,"Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The H-2 blocker famotidine has been suggested as an FDA-approved drug that could potentially be repurposed for treatment of COVID-19. Famotidine has since been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce symptom severity in patients acutely ill with COVID-19. Other studies have suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) might have an association with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether famotidine or any other antireflux medications have a prophylactic or detrimental effect for SARS-CoV-2 infection when taken regularly for the management of acid reflux. METHODS: An anonymous, web-based survey was distributed via email to adult otolaryngology patients to collect demographic data, past medical history, medication history, incidence of symptoms associated with COVID-19, potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and results of any PCR or serological testing. Associations between reflux medications and incidence of COVID-19 cases were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Chi-square with Fisher's exact test, Point-Biserial correlation, Kendall's-tau-b, independent samples t test, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used as appropriate. A binary logistic regression model was fit to determine probability of COVID-19 cases after adjustment for other risk factors. RESULTS: There were 307 patients who responded to the survey. The average age of respondents was 52.63 +/- 17.03. Famotidine use was not associated with incidence of laboratory-confirmed (P= 0.717) or symptomatically suspected (P= 0.876) COVID-19.

However, the impact on maternal mortality and whether morbidity is differentially affected by disease severity at delivery and trimester of infection are unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe disease severity and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pregnancy across the Washington State, including pregnancy complications and outcomes, hospitalization, and case fatality. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, were identified in a multicenter retrospective cohort study from 35 sites in Washington State. Sites captured 61% of annual state deliveries. Case-fatality rates in pregnancy were compared with coronavirus disease 2019 fatality rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State using rate ratios and rate differences. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared by trimester of infection and disease severity at the time of delivery. RESULTS: The principal study findings were as follows: (1) among 240 pregnant patients in Washington State with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections, 1 in 11 developed severe or critical disease, 1 in 10 were hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019, and 1 in 80 died; (2) the coronavirus disease 2019-associated hospitalization rate was 3.5-fold higher than in similarly aged adults in Washington State (10.0% vs 2.8%; rate ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-5.3); (3) pregnant patients hospitalized for a respiratory concern were more likely to have a comorbidity or underlying conditions including asthma, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease, and class III obesity; (4) 3 maternal deaths (1.3%) were attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 for a maternal mortality rate of 1250 of 100,000 pregnancies (95% confidence interval, 257-3653); (5) the coronavirus disease 2019 case fatality in pregnancy was a significant 13.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.7-43.6) higher in pregnant patients than in similarly aged individuals in Washington State with an absolute difference in mortality rate of 1.2% (95% confidence interval, -0.3 to 2.6); and (6) preterm birth was significantly higher among women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 at delivery than for women who had recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (45.4% severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 vs 5.2% mild coronavirus disease 2019; P<.001).

Understanding these differences and how they influence vulnerability to infection and disease severity is critical to public health intervention. AIM: To analyze and compare the profile of COVID-19 cases between China and North America as two regions that differ in many environmental, host and healthcare factors related to disease risk. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis to examine and compare demographic information, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, disease severity and levels of disease biomarkers of COVID-19 cases from clinical studies and data from China (105 studies) and North America (19 studies). RESULTS: COVID-19 patients from North America were older than their Chinese counterparts and with higher male: Female ratio. Fever, cough, fatigue and dyspnea were the most common clinical symptoms in both study regions (present in about 30% to 75% of the cases in both regions). Meta-analysis for the prevalence of comorbidities (such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and chronic kidney diseases) in COVID-19 patients were all significantly more prevalent in North America compared to China.

372,33501998,"BACKGROUND: Norwegian hospitals have operated within capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present patient and management characteristics, and outcomes for the entire cohort of adult (>18 years) COVID-19 patients admitted to Norwegian intensive care units (ICU) from 10 March to 19 June 2020. METHODS: Data were collected from The Norwegian intensive care and pandemic registry (NIPaR). Demographics, co-morbidities, management characteristics and outcomes are described. ICU length of stay (LOS) was analysed with linear regression, and associations between risk factors and mortality were quantified using Cox regression. RESULTS: In total, 217 patients were included. The male to female ratio was 3:1 and the median age was 63 years.

373,33499680,"The worldwide population is facing a double burden of epidemic, the COVID-19 and obesity. This is even more alarming as obesity increases the COVID-19 severity. However, the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 severity is more complex than a simple association with BMI. In particular, obesity has been associated with low death rates in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, a fatal comorbidity to COVID-19, possibly due to the obesity paradox. Also, visceral adiposity could be a major risk factor for COVID-19 severity, due to its immune activation component, release of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and involvement in the cytokine storm, hypercoagulability and embolism. A poor antioxidant nutritional status also weakens the immune system, increasing inflammation and infection risk. Moreover, the COVID-19 lockdown might impact lifestyle patterns, mental health and weight bias, worsening the obesity then COIVD-19 situation. On the other hand, health care expenses and productivity loss are expected to increase during the concomitant epidemics. The co-occurrence of obesity and COVID-19 is a major challenge at both public health and economic levels that should urgently be taken into consideration. The identification of COVID-19 weight related risk factors and the development of appropriate weight management programs are needed to tackle the concomitant epidemics.","The worldwide population is facing a double burden of epidemic, the COVID-19 and obesity.

We conducted a retrospective cohort of 101 patients with COVID-19 from March 3 to June 21, 2020. The patients were divided according to the presence or absence of pneumonia and the severity of the disease. The median age was 42 years and 53% were women. The most common symptoms were fever 66% and cough 57%. Dyspnea and fever were associated with the presence of pneumonia. The most prevalent comorbidities were: hypertension 22%, obesity 18%, cardiovascular disease 7% and chronic respiratory disease 7%. The presence of any comorbidity and hypertension were more common in severe cases. The most frequent laboratory findings were: lymphopenia 55%, elevated D-dimer 38%, and thrombocytopenia 20%. In severe diseases, the level of C-reactive protein and D-dimer were higher. Twenty six patients had pneumonia and 24% were healthcare workers. For diagnosis, more than one reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sample was needed in 24% of cases. A moderate-high value of the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) was more prevalent in severe than mild pneumonia (63% vs. 17%, p 0.032). A mortality of 5% was registered (95% CI 1-11%). The clinical characteristics, severity and prognosis were similar to those described worldwide.

376,33472675,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, enters the cells through a mechanism dependent on its binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein highly expressed in the lungs. The putative viral-induced inhibition of ACE2 could result in the defective degradation of bradykinin, a potent inflammatory substance. We hypothesize that increased bradykinin in the lungs is an important mechanism driving the development of pneumonia and respiratory failure in COVID-19. METHODS: This is a phase II, single-center, three-armed parallel-group, open-label, active control superiority randomized clinical trial. One hundred eighty eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either the inhibitor of C1e/kallikrein 20 U/kg intravenously on day 1 and day 4 plus standard care; or icatibant 30 mg subcutaneously, three doses/day for 4 days plus standard care; or standard care alone, as recommended in the clinical trials published to date, which includes supplemental oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, prophylactic antithrombotic therapy, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy. DISCUSSION: Accumulation of bradykinin in the lungs is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors leading to cough. In animal models, the inactivation of ACE2 leads to severe acute pneumonitis in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the inhibition of bradykinin almost completely restores the lung structure. We believe that inhibition of bradykinin in severe COVID-19 patients could reduce the lung inflammatory response, impacting positively on the severity of disease and mortality rates.

A literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, CENTRAL, OpenGrey and preprint servers medRxiv and bioRxiv was performed, with no restriction on language or date of publication. Primary outcomes of this study were intensive care unit (ICU) admission or critical disease, severe disease and mortality. Secondary outcome was a positive COVID-19 test. Meta-analysis was performed using OpenMeta-Analyst software, and heterogeneity was tested using Cochran's Q test and I2 statistic. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020184953). RESULTS: A total of 1,493 articles were identified and 61 studies on 270,241 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of obesity was 27.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.0-33.2) in hospitalised patients. Obesity was not significantly associated with increased ICU admission or critical illness (odds ratio [OR] 1.25, 95% CI 0.99-1.58, P=0.062, I(2) =31.0) but was significantly associated with more severe disease (OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.41-6.92, P=0.005, I(2) =82.6), mortality (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.69, P=0.006, I(2)=88.5) and a positive COVID-19 test (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.25-1.81, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Obesity increased the risk of severe disease, mortality and infection with COVID-19. Higher body mass index was associated with ICU admission and critical disease. Patients who are obese may be more susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and infected patients should be monitored closely for adverse outcomes.","OBJECTIVE: Obesity has been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes in viral infections such as influenza, but previous studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had mixed results.

The role of ACE2 in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a topic of debate, with clinical and experimental evidence indicating a multifaceted relationship between ACE2 activity and disease severity. Here, we review the mechanisms by which the peptidergic substrates and products of ACE and ACE2 contribute to physiological and pathophysiological processes and hypothesise how down-regulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry disrupts homeostasis. A better understanding of the endocrinology of the disease, in particular the neuroendocrinology of ACE2 during COVID-19, may contribute to the timely design of new therapeutic strategies, including the regulation of ACE2 itself by steroid hormones, to ameliorate the severity of COVID-19.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become the most critical pandemic of the 21st Century and the most severe since the 1918 influenza pandemic.

383,33455936,"OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes within different ethnic groups of a cohort of hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. To quantify and describe the impact of a number of prognostic factors, including frailty and inflammatory markers. SETTING: Five acute National Health Service Hospitals in east London. DESIGN: Prospectively defined observational study using registry data. PARTICIPANTS: 1737 patients aged 16 years or over admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 1 January and 13 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from time of first hospital admission with COVID-19 diagnosis during or prior to admission. Secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU and hospital length of stay and type and duration of organ support. Multivariable survival analyses were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: 1737 were included in our analysis of whom 511 had died by day 30 (29%). 538 (31%) were from Asian, 340 (20%) black and 707 (40%) white backgrounds. Compared with white patients, those from minority ethnic backgrounds were younger, with differing comorbidity profiles and less frailty. Asian and black patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU and to receive invasive ventilation (OR 1.54, (95% CI 1.06 to 2.23); p=0.023 and OR 1.80 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.71); p=0.005, respectively). After adjustment for age and sex, patients from Asian (HR 1.49 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.86); p<0.001) and black (HR 1.30 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.65); p=0.036) backgrounds were more likely to die. These findings persisted across a range of risk factor-adjusted analyses accounting for major comorbidities, obesity, smoking, frailty and ABO blood group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients from Asian and black backgrounds had higher mortality from COVID-19 infection despite controlling for all previously identified confounders and frailty. Higher rates of invasive ventilation indicate greater acute disease severity. Our analyses suggest that patients of Asian and black backgrounds suffered disproportionate rates of premature death from COVID-19.","OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes within different ethnic groups of a cohort of hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection.

384,33455077,"OBJECTIVE: Latino patients are overrepresented among cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are at an increased risk of severe disease. Prevalence of COVID-19 in Latinos with rheumatic diseases is poorly reported. This study was undertaken to characterize COVID-19 clinical features and outcomes in Latino patients with rheumatic diseases. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of Latino patients with rheumatic diseases from an existing observational cohort in the Washington, DC area. Patients seen between April 1, 2020 and October 15, 2020 were analyzed in this study. We reviewed demographic characteristics, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, and use of immunomodulatory therapies. An exploratory classification and regression tree (CART) analysis along with logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for COVID-19 and rheumatic disease flare. RESULTS: Of 178 Latino patients with rheumatic diseases, 32 (18%) were identified as having COVID-19, and the incidence rate of infection was found to be 3-fold higher than in the general Latino population. No patients required intensive care unit-level care. A CART analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis identified a BMI of >30.35 as a risk factor for COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 3.37 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.5-7.7]; P = 0.004). COVID-19 positivity was a risk factor for rheumatic disease flare (OR 4.57 [95% CI 1.2-17.4]; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that Latino patients with rheumatic diseases have a higher rate of COVID-19 compared with the general Latino population. Obesity is a risk factor for COVID-19, and COVID-19 is a risk factor for rheumatic disease flare.

Our objective was to comprehensively evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a clinically diverse COVID-19 convalescent cohort at defined time points to determine if anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist and to identify clinical and demographic factors that correlate with high titers. Using a novel multiplex assay to quantify IgG against four SARS-CoV-2 antigens, a receptor binding domain-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 inhibition assay, and a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay, we found that 98% of COVID-19 convalescent subjects had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies five weeks after symptom resolution (n=113). Further, antibody levels did not decline three months after symptom resolution (n=79). As expected, greater disease severity, older age, male sex, obesity, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score correlated with increased anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. We demonstrated for the first time that COVID-19 symptoms, namely fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and low appetite, correlated consistently with higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels.

387,33436436,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been declared a pandemic, has exhibited a wide range of severity worldwide. Although this global variation is largely affected by socio-medical situations in each country, there is also high individual-level variation attributable to elderliness and certain underlying medical conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. As both elderliness and the aforementioned chronic conditions are often associated with an altered gut microbiota, resulting in disrupted gut barrier integrity, and gut symptoms have consistently been associated with more severe illness in COVID-19 patients, it is possible that dysfunction of the gut as a whole influences COVID-19 severity. This article summarizes the accumulating evidence that supports the hypothesis that an altered gut microbiota and its associated leaky gut may contribute to the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms and occasionally to additional multiorgan complications that may lead to severe illness by allowing leakage of the causative coronavirus into the circulatory system.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been declared a pandemic, has exhibited a wide range of severity worldwide.

388,33430933,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of adult patients with PCR-confirmed Covid-19 infection in a primary open-care setting, as compared to placebo. The study hypothesis is that treatment with HCQ will reduce the risk of hospitalization because of Covid-19 infection, and the sample size estimate of the study is based on the need to test this hypothesis. The secondary objectives of the study are: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HCQ in the treatment of adult patients with PCR-confirmed Covid-19 infection in a primary open-care setting, as compared to placebo; to collect experience of the use of HCQ in the treatment of Covid-19 infection in outpatients, in order to be able to identify patient characteristics that predict specific treatment responses (favourable or unfavourable); this objective will also be addressed by post-hoc subgroup analysis of the study results and by meta-analysis of pooled patient data from other clinical trials of HCQ in outpatients; and to evaluate the impact of Covid-19 infection and its treatment on the mental health and well-being of the study participants. In addition, if the data allow, the study has the following exploratory objectives: to evaluate the extent and duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding by PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swab samples in study subjects treated with HCQ, as compared to placebo; to evaluate the extent and time course of SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific antibody responses in serum of study subjects treated with HCQ, as compared to placebo; to evaluate other possible biomarker changes in blood in study subjects treated with HCQ, as compared to placebo; to explore the possible effects of genetic variation in drug metabolizing enzymes on HCQ-related outcomes in the study population; to explore the associations of HCQ-related outcome variables with other patient characteristics, e.g. HLA haplotypes, HCQ concentrations, demographic variables, disease history and concomitant medications. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group treatment trial comparing HCQ with placebo in outpatients with Covid-19 infection. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the two treatment arms. PARTICIPANTS: Main inclusion criteria: 1. Males and females >40 years of age, or 18-40 years of age with one or both of the following: i. diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2); ii. BMI > 35 kg/m(2); 2. Valid independent informed consent obtained; 3. Symptoms typical of Covid-19 infection, according to criteria specified in the study protocol. The onset of symptoms must be within 5 days of enrolment; 4. Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result of a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Main exclusion criteria: 1. Suspected severe or moderately severe pneumonia, presenting with any of the following: respiratory rate > 26 breaths/min; significant respiratory distress; or SpO2 </=94% on room air; 2. Requiring treatment in the hospital, according to the treating physician's judgement; 3. Any contraindication to treatment with HCQ; 4. Pregnancy or lactation. The trial will be conducted at seven study sites in a primary public health care setting in the region of Satakunta, Finland. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomized to receive either HCQ capsules at 300 mg twice a day for one day and then 200 mg twice a day for 6 days, or placebo capsules for 7 days. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of the study is the number of hospitalizations due to Covid-19 infection within four weeks of entry into the study. The secondary endpoints of the study include the following: duration and severity of Covid-19-related symptoms, as reported by daily self-assessments; number of Intensive Care Unit treatment episodes due to Covid-19 infection within four weeks of entry into the study; number of deaths due to Covid-19 infection within four weeks of entry into the study; number of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs); all-cause hospitalizations and mortality within six months of entry into the study; and self-assessed symptoms of anxiety, as assessed with repeated administration of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7). The exploratory endpoints of the study include the following: extent and duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding and virus-specific antibody responses in serum; and possible other blood biomarker changes. RANDOMISATION: Eligible study participants are randomly allocated into two treatment arms (1:1 ratio). The randomization list has been generated using Viedoc (Viedoc Technologies AB, Uppsala, Sweden) that is used as an electronic data capture system for this study. BLINDING (MASKING): The participants and all study personnel remain blinded to the treatment allocation by having both IMPs packed in identical containers. Masking of the treatments was performed by re-formulation of the IMPs so that the HCQ capsules and the placebo capsules have identical appearance. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): 600 participants are to be randomised with 300 in each arm.

389,33426009,"During the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019) pandemic, researchers have been seeking low-cost and accessible means of providing protection from its harms, particularly for at-risk individuals such as those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. One possible way is via safe sun exposure, and/or dietary supplementation with induced beneficial mediators (e.g., vitamin D). In this narrative review, we provide rationale and updated evidence on the potential benefits and harms of sun exposure and ultraviolet (UV) light that may impact COVID-19. We review recent studies that provide new evidence for any benefits (or otherwise) of UV light, sun exposure, and the induced mediators, vitamin D and nitric oxide, and their potential to modulate morbidity and mortality induced by infection with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus-2). We identified substantial interest in this research area, with many commentaries and reviews already published; however, most of these have focused on vitamin D, with less consideration of UV light (or sun exposure) or other mediators such as nitric oxide. Data collected to-date suggest that ambient levels of both UVA and UVB may be beneficial for reducing severity or mortality due to COVID-19, with some inconsistent findings. Currently unresolved are the nature of the associations between blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D and COVID-19 measures, with more prospective data needed that better consider lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and personal sun exposure levels. Another short-coming has been a lack of measurement of sun exposure, and its potential to influence COVID-19 outcomes. We also discuss possible mechanisms by which sun exposure, UV light and induced mediators could affect COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, by focusing on likely effects on viral pathogenesis, immunity and inflammation, and potential cardiometabolic protective mechanisms. Finally, we explore potential issues including the impacts of exposure to high dose UV radiation on COVID-19 and vaccination, and effective and safe doses for vitamin D supplementation.","During the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019) pandemic, researchers have been seeking low-cost and accessible means of providing protection from its harms, particularly for at-risk individuals such as those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity.

390,33421506,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Few studies distinguished the independent role of overweight/obesity or their associated-comorbidities in the evolution towards severe forms of COVID-19. Obesity as a unifying risk factor for severe COVID-19 is an emerging hypothesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether excessive body weight per se, was a risk factor for developing a severe form of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 131 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in a single center of the internal medicine department in Marseille, France. We recorded anthropometric and metabolic parameters such as fasting glycaemia, insulinemia, HOMA-IR, lipids, and all clinical criteria linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection at the admission. Excess body weight was defined by a BMI>/=25kg/m(2). The occurrence of a serious event was defined as a high-debit oxygen requirement over 6L/min, admission into the intensive care unit, or death. RESULTS: Among 113 patients, two thirds (n=76, 67%) had an excess body weight. The number of serious events was significantly higher in excess body weight patients compared to normal weight patients (respectively 25% vs 8%, p=0.03) although excess body weight patients were younger (respectively 63.6 vs 70.3years old, p=0.01). In multivariate analyses, the excess body weight status was the only predictor for developing a serious event linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an odds ratio at 5.6 (95% CI: 1.30-23.96; p=0.02), independently of previous obesity associated comorbidities. There was a trend towards a positive association between the BMI (normal weight, overweight and obesity) and the risk of serious events linked to COVID-19, with a marked increase from 8.1% to 20% and 30.6% respectively (p=0.05). CONCLUSION: Excess body weight was significantly associated with severe forms of the disease, independently of its classical associated comorbidities. Physicians and specialists in Public Health must be sensitized to better protect people with an excess body weight against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Few studies distinguished the independent role of overweight/obesity or their associated-comorbidities in the evolution towards severe forms of COVID-19.

Random-effect models were used to estimate the pooled effects. RESULTS: The systematic review yielded 3 retrospective studies on 9022 patients. The risk of mortality without previous bariatric surgery was 133 per 1000 cases and its risk with previous bariatric surgery was 33 per 1000 (summary OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.19-0.26). No heterogeneity was observed between the included studies (I(2) = 0%, P = 0.98 for heterogeneity).

392,33414226,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients infected with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can develop a spectrum of neurological disorders, including a leukoencephalopathy of variable severity. Our aim was to characterize imaging, lab, and clinical correlates of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leukoencephalopathy, which may provide insight into the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 who had brain MR imaging following intensive care unit admission were included. Seven (7/27, 26%) developed an unusual pattern of ""leukoencephalopathy with reduced diffusivity"" on diffusion-weighted MR imaging. The remaining patients did not exhibit this pattern. Clinical and laboratory indices, as well as neuroimaging findings, were compared between groups. RESULTS: The reduced-diffusivity group had a significantly higher body mass index (36 versus 28 kg/m(2), P < .01). Patients with reduced diffusivity trended toward more frequent acute renal failure (7/7, 100% versus 9/20, 45%; P = .06) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate values (49 versus 85 mL/min; P = .06) at the time of MRI. Patients with reduced diffusivity also showed lesser mean values of the lowest hemoglobin levels (8.1 versus 10.2 g/dL, P < .05) and higher serum sodium levels (147 versus 139 mmol/L, P = .04) within 24 hours before MR imaging. The reduced-diffusivity group showed a striking and highly reproducible distribution of confluent, predominantly symmetric, supratentorial, and middle cerebellar peduncular white matter lesions (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight notable correlations between severe COVID-19 leukoencephalopathy with reduced diffusivity and obesity, acute renal failure, mild hypernatremia, anemia, and an unusual brain MR imaging white matter lesion distribution pattern. Together, these observations may shed light on possible SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with leukoencephalopathy, including borderzone ischemic changes, electrolyte transport disturbances, and silent hypoxia in the setting of the known cytokine storm syndrome that accompanies severe COVID-19.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients infected with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can develop a spectrum of neurological disorders, including a leukoencephalopathy of variable severity. Our aim was to characterize imaging, lab, and clinical correlates of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leukoencephalopathy, which may provide insight into the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 who had brain MR imaging following intensive care unit admission were included. Seven (7/27, 26%) developed an unusual pattern of ""leukoencephalopathy with reduced diffusivity"" on diffusion-weighted MR imaging. The remaining patients did not exhibit this pattern. Clinical and laboratory indices, as well as neuroimaging findings, were compared between groups. RESULTS: The reduced-diffusivity group had a significantly higher body mass index (36 versus 28 kg/m(2), P < .01). Patients with reduced diffusivity trended toward more frequent acute renal failure (7/7, 100% versus 9/20, 45%; P = .06) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate values (49 versus 85 mL/min; P = .06) at the time of MRI.

393,33413813,"Behavioral lifestyle factors are associated with cardiometabolic disease and obesity, which are risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to investigate whether physical activity, and the timing and balance of physical activity and sleep/rest, were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 severity. Data from 91,248 UK Biobank participants with accelerometer data and complete covariate and linked COVID-19 data to July 19, 2020, were included. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and COVID-19 severity-in relation to overall physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), balance between activity and sleep/rest, and variability in timing of sleep/rest-was assessed with adjusted logistic regression. Of 207 individuals with a positive test result, 124 were classified as having a severe infection. Overall physical activity and MVPA were not associated with severe COVID-19, whereas a poor balance between activity and sleep/rest was (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 0.81]). This finding was related to higher daytime activity being associated with lower risk (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.93) but higher movement during sleep/rest being associated with higher risk (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.42) of severe infection. Greater variability in timing of sleep/rest was also associated with increased risk (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.35). Results for testing positive were broadly consistent. In conclusion, these results highlight the importance of not just physical activity, but also quality sleep/rest and regular sleep/rest patterns, on risk of COVID-19. Our findings indicate the risk of COVID-19 was consistently approximately 1.2-fold greater per approximately 40-minute increase in variability in timing of proxy measures of sleep, indicative of irregular sleeping patterns.","Behavioral lifestyle factors are associated with cardiometabolic disease and obesity, which are risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

394,33412808,"As the Coronavirus situation (COVID-19) continues to evolve, many questions concerning the factors relating to the diffusion and severity of the disease remain unanswered.Whilst opinions regarding the weight of evidence for these risk factors, and the studies published so far are often inconclusive or offer contrasting results, the role of comorbidities in the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients affected with COVID-19 appears to be evident since the outset. Hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are under discussion as important factors affecting the severity of disease. Air pollution has been considered to play a role in the diffusion of the virus, in the propagation of the contagion, in the severity of symptoms, and in the poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that environmental particulate matter (PM) can trigger inflammatory responses at molecular, cellular, and organ levels, sustaining respiratory, cardiovascular, and dysmetabolic diseases.To better understand the intricate relationships among pre-existing conditions, PM, and viral infection, we examined the response at the molecular level of T47D human breast adenocarcinoma cells exposed to different fractions of PM. T47D cells express several receptors, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and ACE2, the main - but not the only - receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry.PM samples were collected in an urban background site located in the Northern area of the City of Bologna (Emilia-Romagna Region, Northern Italy) during winter 2013. T47D cells were exposed to organic or aqueous (inorganic) extracts at the final concentration of 8 m3 for a 4-hour duration. Both the concentration and the exposure time were chosen to resemble an average outdoor exposure. RNA was extracted from cells, purified and hybridised on 66k microarray slides from Agilent.The lists of differentially expressed genes in PM organic extracts were evaluated by using Metacore, and an enrichment analysis was performed to identify pathways maps, process networks, and disease by biomarkers altered after T47D treatment.The analysis of the modulated genes gave evidence for the involvement of PM in dysmetabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity, and hypertension through the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) canonical pathway.On the basis of current knowledge, existing data, and exploratory experimental evidence, we tease out the likely molecular interplay that can ultimately tip the disease outcome into severity. Looking beyond ACE2, several additional key markers are identified. Disruption of these targets worsens pre-existing conditions and/or exacerbates the adverse effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whilst appropriately designed, epidemiological studies are very much needed to investigate these associations based on our hypothesis of investigation, by reviewing recent experimental and epidemiological evidence, here we speculate and provide new insights on the possible role of environmental pollution in the exacerbation of effects by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. This work is intended to assist in the development of appropriate investigative approaches to protect public health.","As the Coronavirus situation (COVID-19) continues to evolve, many questions concerning the factors relating to the diffusion and severity of the disease remain unanswered.Whilst opinions regarding the weight of evidence for these risk factors, and the studies published so far are often inconclusive or offer contrasting results, the role of comorbidities in the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients affected with COVID-19 appears to be evident since the outset.

We aimed to determine the effects of chronic comorbidities on clinical outcomes of patients with and without COVID-19. This was an analysis of 65,535 patients with suspicion of viral respiratory disease (38,324 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 27,211 SARS-CoV-2 negative) from January 01 to May 12, 2020 using the national administrative healthcare open data of Mexico. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction. General characteristics and chronic comorbidities were explored. Clinical outcomes of interest were hospital admission, pneumonia, intensive care unit admission, endotracheal intubation and mortality. Prevalence of chronic comorbidities was 49.4%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the effect of age, male sex, bronchial asthma, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease on clinical outcomes was similar for both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. Adverse clinical outcomes were associated with the time from symptoms onset to medical contact, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and obesity in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, but with cardiovascular disease in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (p value < 0.01 for all comparisons). Chronic comorbidities are commonly found in patients with suspicion of viral respiratory disease. The knowledge of the impact of comorbidities on adverse clinical outcomes can better define those COVID-19 patients at higher risk.

397,33406518,"OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors for the severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in comparison with the non-severe patients. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CNKI to collect all relevant studies published before July 26, 2020, and a total of 30 papers were included in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: In the severe COVID-19 patients, 60% (95% CI = 56-64%) were male, 25% (95% CI = 21-29%) were over 65 years old, 34% (95% CI = 24-44%) were obese, and 55% (95% CI = 41-70%) had comorbidities. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (34%, 95% CI = 25-44%), diabetes (20%, 95% CI = 15-25%), and cardiovascular disease (CVD; 12%, 95% CI = 9-16%). The most common blood test abnormalities were elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; 87%, 82-92%), decreased lymphocyte count (68%, 58-77%), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (69%, 95% CI = 57-81%). In addition, abnormal laboratory findings revealing organ dysfunctions were frequently observed in the severe cases, including decrease in albumin (43%, 95% CI = 24-63%) and increase in aspartate aminotransferase (47%, 95% CI = 38-56%), alanine aminotransferase (28%, 95% CI = 16-39%), troponin I/troponin T (TnI/TnT; 29%, 95% CI = 13-45%), and serum Cr (SCr; 10%, 95% CI = 5-15%). CONCLUSION: The male, elderly and obese patients and those with any comorbidities, especially with hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, were more likely to develop into severe cases. But the association between hypertension, diabetes, CVD, and severity of COVID-19 was declined by the increase of age. A significant elevation in cardiac TnI/TnT, the hepatic enzymes, and SCr and the reduction in lymphocytes with elevated CRPs are important markers for the severity.

400,33397449,"OBJECTIVES: Conestat alfa, a recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor, is a multi-target inhibitor of inflammatory cascades including the complement, the kinin-kallikrein and the contact activation system. The study objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of conestat alfa in improving disease severity and short-term outcome in COVID-19 patients with pulmonary disease. TRIAL DESIGN: This study is an investigator-initiated, randomized (2:1 ratio), open-label, parallel-group, controlled, multi-center, phase 2a clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: This trial is conducted in 3 hospitals in Switzerland, 1 hospital in Brazil and 1 hospital in Mexico (academic and non-academic). All patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospitalization for at least 3 calendar days for severe COVID-19 will be screened for study eligibility. INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Signed informed consent - Age 18-85 years - Evidence of pulmonary involvement on CT scan or X-ray of the chest - Duration of symptoms associated with COVID-19 </= 10 days - At least one of the following risk factors for progression to mechanical ventilation on the day of enrolment: 1) Arterial hypertension 2) >/= 50 years 3) Obesity (BMI >/= 30 kg/m2) 4) History of cardiovascular disease 5) Chronic pulmonary disease 6) Chronic renal disease 7) C-reactive protein > 35mg/L 8) Oxygen saturation at rest of </= 94% when breathing ambient air Exclusion criteria: - Incapacity or inability to provide informed consent - Contraindications to the class of drugs under investigation (C1 esterase inhibitor) - Treatment with tocilizumab or another IL-6R or IL-6 inhibitor before enrolment - History or suspicion of allergy to rabbits - Pregnancy or breast feeding - Active or anticipated treatment with any other complement inhibitor - Liver cirrhosis (any Child-Pugh score) - Admission to an ICU on the day or anticipated within the next 24 hours of enrolment - Invasive or non-invasive ventilation - Participation in another study with any investigational drug within the 30 days prior to enrolment - Enrolment of the study investigators, their family members, employees and other closely related or dependent persons INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomized to the experimental arm will receive conestat alfa in addition to standard of care (SOC). Conestat alfa (8400 U followed by 4200 U every 8 hours) will be administered as a slow intravenous injection (5-10 minutes) over a 72-hour period (i.e. 9 administrations in total). The first conestat alfa treatment will be administered on the day of enrolment. The control group will receive SOC only. SOC treatment will be administered according to local institutional guidelines, including supplemental oxygen, antibiotics, corticosteroids, remdesivir, and anticoagulation. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of this trial is disease severity on day 7 after enrolment assessed by an adapted WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (score 0 will be omitted and score 6 and 7 will be combined) from 1 (no limitation of activities) to 7 (death). Secondary outcomes include (i) the time to clinical improvement (time from randomization to an improvement of two points on the WHO ordinal scale or discharge from hospital) within 14 days after enrolment, (ii) the proportion of participants alive and not having required invasive or non-invasive ventilation at 14 days after enrolment and (iii) the proportion of subjects without an acute lung injury (defined by PaO2/FiO2 ratio of </=300mmHg) within 14 days after enrolment. Exploratory outcomes include virological clearance, C1 esterase inhibitor pharmacokinetics and changes in routine laboratory parameters and inflammatory proteins. RANDOMISATION: Subjects will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with conestat alfa in addition to SOC or SOC only. Randomization is performed via an interactive web response system (SecuTrial(R)). BLINDING (MASKING): In this open-label trial, participants, caregivers and outcome assessors are not blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): We will randomise approximately 120 individuals (80 in the active treatment arm, 40 in the SOC group). Two interim analyses after 40 and 80 patients are planned according to the Pocock adjusted levels alphap = 0.0221. The results of the interim analysis will allow adjustment of the sample size (Lehmacher, Wassmer, 1999). TRIAL STATUS: PROTECT-COVID-19 protocol version 3.0 (July 07 2020). Participant recruitment started on July 30 2020 in one center (Basel, Switzerland, first participant included on August 06 2020). In four of five study centers patients are actively recruited.

The COVID-19 is not only a simple viral infection of the bronchial system but is also a pandemic hyperinflammatory multiorgan disease. The cardiovascular system plays a causal role in this context, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), an enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity play an important role in the severity of the course of the disease. Additional risk factors, such as gender, age, genetics and air pollution modulate both the severity of the SARS-CoV2 infection as well as cardiovascular diseases. As sequelae of COVID-19, increased thrombosis, myocardial infarction, myocardial inflammation and vasculitis occur, which directly damage the cardiovascular system and substantially contribute to the high morbidity and mortality. Knowledge gained from many studies on the course of the disease in patients infected with SARS-CoV2 has led to improved treatment possibilities, which now in the second wave are partly standardized and were, and are, in particular adapted to complications of the cardiovascular system.

More than 90% of those infected with COVID-19 show mild or no symptoms but the rest of the infected cases show severe symptoms resulting in significant mortality. Age has emerged as a major factor to predict the severity of the disease and mortality rates are significantly higher in elderly patients. Besides, patients with underlying conditions like Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and cancer have an increased risk of severe disease and death due to COVID-19 infection. Obesity has emerged as a novel risk factor for hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. Several independent studies have observed that people with obesity are at a greater risk of severe disease and death due to COVID-19. Here we review the published data related to obesity and overweight to assess the possible risk and outcome in Covid-19 patients based on their body weight. Besides, we explore how the obese host provides a unique microenvironment for disease pathogenesis, resulting in increased severity of the disease and poor outcome.","The disease (COVID-19) novel coronavirus pandemic has so far infected millions resulting in the death of over a million people as of Oct 2020.

404,33388780,"BACKGROUND: There is limited information on the association between upper respiratory tract (URT) viral loads, host factors, and disease severity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. METHODS: We studied 1122 patients (mean age, 46 years) diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). URT viral load, measured by PCR cycle threshold, was categorized as high, moderate, or low. RESULTS: There were 336 (29.9%) patients with comorbidities; 309 patients (27.5%) had high, 316 (28.2%) moderate, and 497 (44.3%) low viral load. In univariate analyses, compared to patients with moderate or low viral load, patients with high viral load were older, more often had comorbidities, developed Symptomatic disease (COVID-19), were intubated, and died. Patients with high viral load had longer stay in intensive care unit and longer intubation compared to patients with low viral load (P values < .05 for all comparisons). Patients with chronic cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic pulmonary disease, immunosuppression, obesity, and chronic neurological disease more often had high viral load (P value < .05 for all comparisons). In multivariate analysis high viral load was associated with COVID-19. Level of viral load was not associated with any other outcome. CONCLUSIONS: URT viral load could be used to identify patients at higher risk for morbidity or severe outcome.","BACKGROUND: There is limited information on the association between upper respiratory tract (URT) viral loads, host factors, and disease severity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

405,33388408,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection can cause alterations in the coagulation mechanism conditioning thrombotic phenomena such as acute limb ischemia (ALI) as the only manifestation of the infection. The aim of the study was to describe clinical and surgical characteristics of a group of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 who presented ALI in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic at Lima, Peru. METHODS: A multicenter, observational, and retrospective study was performed in six general hospitals, from March to July 2020. The variables considered were the pathological history and associated habits, laboratory tests, the severity of COVID-19 infection and ALI, the anatomic location of the lesion, treatment, evolution, and discharge conditions. RESULTS: Thirty patients with ALI infected with COVID-19 were evaluated. Their mean age was 60 +/- 15 years, the condition being more frequent in men (76.6%). The main comorbidities were arterial hypertension (33.3%), obesity (33.3%), and diabetes mellitus 2 (26.6%). There were 23.3% asymptomatic patients, and their only manifestation was ALI. Rutherford IIA and IIB stage included 93.2% of patients. The most frequent location of the thrombosis was the lower limbs (73.3% vs. 26.6%). Thrombectomy was performed in 76.6% of the patients, and amputation (primary and secondary) was performed in 30% of the patients. The mortality rate was 23.3%, all of it because of acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: ALI is a vascular pathology associated with embolic and thrombotic processes. COVID-19 infection can cause severe alterations in coagulation mechanisms, leading some patients to present severe acute arterial complications such as thrombosis, as the only associated manifestation. We report a younger cohort than those described in other studies and with a high frequency of amputations despite adequate surgical treatment.","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection can cause alterations in the coagulation mechanism conditioning thrombotic phenomena such as acute limb ischemia (ALI) as the only manifestation of the infection.

406,33388022,"INTRODUCTION: Currently, diabetes mellitus (DM), as well as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are major public health issues worldwide. BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that patients with DM are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and suffer from more severe forms of the disease. METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, and Google search engines. RESULTS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the major receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in the human host. The differential expression of ACE2 in the lungs of patients with DM makes them more susceptible to COVID-19. Additionally, acute or chronic hyperglycemia renders individuals in an immune-suppressive state, with impaired innate and adaptive immunity function, also contributing to the severity of COVID-19 infection among patients with DM. Other factors contributing to a more severe course of COVID-19 include the coexistence of obesity in T2DM, the endothelial inflammation induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which aggravates the endothelial dysfunction observed in both T1DM and T2DM, and the hypercoagulability presented in COVID-19 infection that increases the thrombotic tendency in DM. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the coexistence of both pandemics as well as the current recommendations and future perspectives regarding the optimal treatment of inpatients and outpatients with DM in the era of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the currently recommended drugs for the treatment of severe COVID-19, dexamethasone and remdesivir, may cause hyperglycemia, an adverse effect that physicians should bear in mind when caring for patients with DM and COVID-19.","INTRODUCTION: Currently, diabetes mellitus (DM), as well as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are major public health issues worldwide.

407,33386398,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the entry receptor for coronaviruses into human cells, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since hypertension (HT) is a leading comorbidity in non-survivors of COVID-19, we tested for association between ACE2 gene and HT in interaction with specific pre-existing conditions known to be associated with COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Genetic analysis of ACE2 gene was conducted in French-Canadian (FC) and British populations. RESULTS: In FC individuals, the T allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs2074192 of ACE2 gene was a risk factor for HT in adult obese males [odds ratio (OR) = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.83)] and even more so in obese males who smoked (OR = 1.67, CI: 1.24-2.55), but not in lean males, non-smoker males or females. The T allele was significantly associated with severity of HT and with earlier penetrance of HT in obese smoking males. Significant interaction between the T allele and obesity was present in both sexes. The association of ACE2 (rs233575) genotype with blood pressure was also seen in adolescents but the interaction with obesity was present only in females. Several variants in ACE2 gene were found to be associated with HT in obese, smoking males in British individuals of the UK Biobank. In addition, we observed more severe outcomes to COVID-19 in association with ACE2 risk alleles in obese, smoking males. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that ACE2 variants are associated with earlier penetrance and more severe HT and with more severe outcomes of COVID-19 in obese smoking males.","BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the entry receptor for coronaviruses into human cells, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

409,33381779,"INTRODUCTION: Pregnant women are reported to be at increased risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to underlying immunosuppression during pregnancy. However, the clinical course of COVID-19 in pregnancy and risk of vertical and horizontal transmission remain relatively unknown. We aim to describe and evaluate outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in Singapore. METHODS: Prospective observational study of 16 pregnant patients admitted for COVID-19 to 4 tertiary hospitals in Singapore. Outcomes included severe disease, pregnancy loss, and vertical and horizontal transmission. RESULTS: Of the 16 patients, 37.5%, 43.8% and 18.7% were infected in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. Two gravidas aged >/=35 years (12.5%) developed severe pneumonia; one patient (body mass index 32.9kg/m2) required transfer to intensive care. The median duration of acute infection was 19 days; one patient remained reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive >11 weeks from diagnosis. There were no maternal mortalities. Five pregnancies produced term live-births while 2 spontaneous miscarriages occurred at 11 and 23 weeks. RT-PCR of breast milk and maternal and neonatal samples taken at birth were negative; placenta and cord histology showed non-specific inflammation; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific immunoglobulins were elevated in paired maternal and umbilical cord blood (n=5). CONCLUSION: The majority of COVID-19 infected pregnant women had mild disease and only 2 women with risk factors (obesity, older age) had severe infection; this represents a slightly higher incidence than observed in age-matched non-pregnant women.

410,33378278,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently one of the most important public health crises affecting the global human population. It continues to spread widely, as the world still lacks specific treatments and a vaccine for the virus. The scenario of COVID-19 in Yemen seems obscure due to the lack of adequate data, therefore, we developed an electronic questionnaire and distributed it online among Yemeni people. The aim of this study was to understand the COVID-19 epidemiological situation in Yemen better since there is currently limited published data and limited availability of COVID-19 testing. METHODOLOGY: A 34-question web-based survey was distributed on social media outlets targeting people in Yemen. Data aggregation, analysis, and visualization were performed using Tableau and Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: 2,341 individuals reported symptoms concerning for COVID-19 infection, with 25.4% reporting a chronic medical condition.

It continues to spread widely, as the world still lacks specific treatments and a vaccine for the virus. The scenario of COVID-19 in Yemen seems obscure due to the lack of adequate data, therefore, we developed an electronic questionnaire and distributed it online among Yemeni people. The aim of this study was to understand the COVID-19 epidemiological situation in Yemen better since there is currently limited published data and limited availability of COVID-19 testing. METHODOLOGY: A 34-question web-based survey was distributed on social media outlets targeting people in Yemen. Data aggregation, analysis, and visualization were performed using Tableau and Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: 2,341 individuals reported symptoms concerning for COVID-19 infection, with 25.4% reporting a chronic medical condition.

411,33378062,"OBJECTIVE: Recently, two influential articles that reported the association of (hydroxy)chloroquine or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality were retracted due to significant methodological issues. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the same clinical issues through an improved research method and to find out the differences from the retracted papers. We systematically reviewed pre-existing literature, and compared the results with those of the retracted papers to gain a novel insight. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted common risk factors identified in two retracted papers, and conducted relevant publication search until June 26, 2020 in PubMed. Then, we analyzed the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality and compared them to those of the retracted papers. RESULTS: Our systematic review demonstrated that most demographic and clinical risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were similar to those of the retracted papers. However, while the retracted paper indicated that both (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy and combination therapy with macrolide were associated with higher risk of mortality, our study showed that only combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and macrolide was associated with higher risk of mortality (odds ratio 2.33; 95% confidence interval 1.63-3.34). In addition, our study demonstrated that use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) was associated with reduced risk of mortality (0.77; 0.65-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: When analyzing the same clinical issues with the two retracted papers through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and relevant cohort studies, we found out that (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy was not associated with higher risk of mortality, and that the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs was associated with reduced risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.","OBJECTIVE: Recently, two influential articles that reported the association of (hydroxy)chloroquine or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality were retracted due to significant methodological issues.

OBJECTIVE: To identify which clinical characteristics are related to COVID-19 severity and to determine whether age acts a modifier of the relationship between cardio-metabolic comorbidities (CMC) and COVID-19 progression. METHOD: Data on >/= 20-year-old confirmed cases (n = 159,017) were analyzed. Hospitalization, development of pneumonia, intubation requirement, intensive care unit admission and death were the dependent variables in Poisson regression models estimation, whereas the interaction between age and different CMCs were the independent variables. RESULTS: Having CMCs, as well as other comorbidities, was directly related to COVID-19 progression, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was only related to an increase in the risk of dying. The risk for COVID-19 severity was lower as age was more advanced. Asthma and smoking were not risk factors for the progression of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In the Mexican population, the risk of COVID-19 progression associated with comorbidities was higher in young adults.","INTRODUCTION: Obesity, diabetes, hypertension and age have been pointed at as factors that influence on the progression of COVID-19; however, evidence for other conditions is inconclusive.

413,33370397,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients at high-risk of poor prognosis is crucial. We aimed to establish predictive models for COVID-19 pneumonia severity in hospitalized patients. METHODS: Retrospective study of 430 patients admitted in Vall d'Hebron Hospital (Barcelona) between 03-12-2020 and 04-28-2020 due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Two models to identify the patients who required high-flow-oxygen-support were generated, one using baseline data and another with also follow-up analytical results. Calibration was performed by a 1000-bootstrap replication model. RESULTS: 249 were male, mean age 57.9 years. Overall, 135 (31.4%) required high-flow-oxygen-support. The baseline predictive model showed a ROC of 0.800 based on: SpO2/FiO2 (adjusted Hazard Ratio-aHR = 8), chest x-ray (aHR = 4), prior immunosuppressive therapy (aHR = 4), obesity (aHR = 2), IL-6 (aHR = 2), platelets (aHR = 0.5). The cut-off of 11 presented a specificity of 94.8%. The second model included changes on the analytical parameters: ferritin (aHR = 7.5 if >/=200ng/mL) and IL-6 (aHR = 18 if >/=64pg/mL) plus chest x-ray (aHR = 2) showing a ROC of 0.877.

METHODS: This is an observational study composed of patients admitted to the ICU. Demographics, anthropometric data for calculating body mass index (BMI), and laboratory data were obtained at admission: blood count, ferritin, arterial blood gas, serum zinc levels, and C-reactive protein. Also, arterial oxygen tension (PaO2 ) divided by fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) was calculated by the first arterial blood gas after intubation. A diagnosis of severe ARDS was determined if the PaO2 /FiO2 ratio was </=100 mm Hg. Low zinc levels were established if zinc levels were <70 mug/dL. RESULTS: A total of 269 patients met inclusion criteria; 51.3% were men; median age was 74 (66-81) years; 91.1% (245 of 269) were elderly.

419,33352455,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several observational studies have recently reported the outcomes of non-insulin anti-diabetic agents (ADA) in patients with T2DM and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We sought to review the literature to appraise the clinicians on these outcomes. METHODS: A literature search using the specific keywords was carried out in the database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar up till December 11, 2020 applying Boolean method. Full text of all the relevant articles that reported the outcomes of ADA in patients with T2DM and COVID-19 were retrieved. Subsequently, an appraisal of literature report was narratively presented. RESULTS: Available studies that reported the outcomes of ADA are either case series or retrospective cohorts or prospective observational studies, in absence of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Results from these observational studies suggest that amongst all the non-insulin ADA, metformin users prior to the hospitalization had improved outcomes compared to the non-users. Data for dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) are encouraging although inconsistent. No documentation of any harm or benefit has been observed for sulfonylureas (SUs), sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). No data is yet available for pioglitazone. CONCLUSION: Metformin and DPP-4i should be continued in patients with T2DM until hospitalization or unless contraindicated. No evidence of harm suggests that SUs, SGLT-2i or GLP-1RAs may not be stopped unless very sick, hospitalized or contraindicated. The results from RCTs are needed to claim any meaningful benefit with either metformin or DPP-4i in patients with T2DM and COVID-19.","BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several observational studies have recently reported the outcomes of non-insulin anti-diabetic agents (ADA) in patients with T2DM and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

420,33350674,"BACKGROUND: There is a scarcity of data on the consequences of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infections in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) from emerging countries. METHODS: Here, we present a cohort study of 13 transplant centers in India including 250 KTR (226 living and 24 deceased donors) with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 positivity from March 23, 2020, until September 15, 2020. We detailed demographics, immunosuppression regimen, clinical profile, treatment, and outcomes. RESULTS: Median age of transplant recipients was 43 years, and recipients presented at a median of 3.5 years after transplant. Most common comorbidities (94%) included arterial hypertension (84%) and diabetes (32%); presenting symptoms at the time of COVID-19 included fever (88%), cough (72%), and sputum production (52%). Clinical severity ranged from asymptomatic (6%), mild (60%), and moderate (20%) to severe (14%). Strategies to modify immunosuppressants included discontinuation of antimetabolites without changes in calcineurin inhibitors and steroids (60%). Risk factors for mortality included older age; dyspnea; severe disease; obesity; allograft dysfunction before COVID-19 infection; acute kidney injury; higher levels of inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 level, and procalcitonin; chest X-ray abnormality, and intensive care unit/ventilator requirements. Overall patient mortality was 11.6% (29 of 250), 14.5% (29 of 200) in hospitalized patients, 47% (25 of 53) in intensive care unit patients, and 96.7% (29 of 30) in patients requiring ventilation. KTRs with mild COVID-19 symptoms (n = 50) were managed as outpatients to optimize the utilization of scarce resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

421,33349845,"BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with COVID-19 infection is uncertain. We derived and validated a new risk model for predicting progression to disease severity, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection (Gal-COVID-19 scores). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in Galicia, Spain. Data were extracted from electronic health records of patients, including age, sex and comorbidities according to International Classification of Primary Care codes (ICPC-2). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the probability of disease severity. Calibration and discrimination were evaluated to assess model performance. RESULTS: The incidence of infection was 0.39% (10 454 patients). A total of 2492 patients (23.8%) required hospitalization, 284 (2.7%) were admitted to the ICU and 544 (5.2%) died. The variables included in the models to predict severity included age, gender and chronic comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, liver disease, chronic kidney disease and haematological cancer. The models demonstrated a fair-good fit for predicting hospitalization {AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve] 0.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76, 0.78]}, admission to ICU [AUC 0.83 (95%CI 0.81, 0.85)] and death [AUC 0.89 (95%CI 0.88, 0.90)].

425,33336769,"OBJECTIVE: Since the emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the death toll has been increasing daily. Many risk factors are associated with a high mortality rate in COVID-19. Establishment of a common pathway among these risk factors could improve our understanding of COVID-19 severity and mortality. This review aims at establishing this common pathway and its possible effect on COVID-19 mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current review was executed in five consecutive stages starting from determining the risk factors of COVID-19 mortality and trying to find a common pathway among them depending on the available literature. This was followed by proposing a mechanism explaining how this common pathway could increase the mortality. Finally, its potential role in managing COVID-19 was proposed. RESULTS: This review identified this common pathway to be a low baseline of reduced glutathione (i.e., GSH) level. In particular, this review provided an in-depth discussion regarding the pathophysiology by which COVID-19 leads to GSH depletion, tissue damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, the current review demonstrated how GSH depletion could result in failure of the immune system and rendering the end organs vulnerable to damage from the oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: This preclinical study shows that GSH depletion may have a central role in COVID-19 mortality and pathophysiology. Therefore, elevating the GSH level in tissues may decrease the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19.","OBJECTIVE: Since the emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the death toll has been increasing daily.

427,33330879,"OBJECTIVE: To measure the association of race, ethnicity, comorbidities, and insurance status with need for hospitalization of symptomatic Emergency Department (ED) patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: This study is a retrospective case-series of symptomatic patients presenting to a single ED with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 12-August 9, 2020. We collected patient-level information regarding demographics, public insurance status (Medicare or Medicaid), comorbidities, level of care, and mortality using a structured chart review. We compared demographics and comorbidities of patients who were (1) able to convalesce at home, (2) required admission to general medical service, (3) required admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or (4) died within 30 days of the index visit. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to report adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and the associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) with hospital admission versus ED discharge home. RESULTS: In total, 993 patients who presented to the ED with symptoms were included in the analysis with 370 (37.3%) patients requiring hospital admission and 70 (7.1%) patients requiring ICU care. Patients requiring admission were more likely to be Black or African American, to be Hispanic or Latino, or to have public insurance (either Medicaid or Medicare.) On multivariable logistic regression analysis comparing which patients required hospital admission, African-American race (aOR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7-2.8) and Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 1.1, 95% CI 0.5-2.0) were not associated with need for admission but, public insurance (Medicaid: aOR 3.4, 95% CI 2.2-5.4; Medicare: aOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.2-5.3; Medicaid and Medicare: aOR 3.6 95% CI 2.1-6.2) and the presence of hypertension (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7), diabetes (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.5), obesity (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.5), heart failure (aOR 3.9, 95% CI 1.4-11.2), and hyperlipidemia (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.9) were identified as independent predictors of hospital admission. CONCLUSION: Comorbidities and public insurance are predictors of more severe illness for patients with SARS-CoV-2. This study suggests that the disparities in severity seen in COVID-19 among African Americans and Hispanics are likely to be closely related to low socioeconomic status and chronic health conditions and do not reflect an independent predisposition to disease severity.","OBJECTIVE: To measure the association of race, ethnicity, comorbidities, and insurance status with need for hospitalization of symptomatic Emergency Department (ED) patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

428,33327744,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide and the pandemic has yet to wane. Despite its associated significant morbidity and mortality, there are no definitive cures and no fully preventative measures to combat SARS-CoV-2. Hence, the urgency to identify the pathobiological mechanisms underlying increased risk for and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mounting. One contributing factor, the accumulation of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules, is a leading trigger for the activation of nuclear factor-kB and the IRF (interferon regulatory factors), such as IRF7. Activation of these pathways, particularly in the lung and other organs, such as the heart, contributes to a burst of cytokine release, which predisposes to significant tissue damage, loss of function, and mortality. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) binds damage-associated molecular patterns is expressed in the lung and heart, and in priming organs, such as the blood vessels (in diabetes) and adipose tissue (in obesity), and transduces the pathological signals emitted by damage-associated molecular patterns. It is proposed that damage-associated molecular pattern-RAGE enrichment in these priming tissues, and in the lungs and heart during active infection, contributes to the widespread tissue damage induced by SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, the RAGE axis might play seminal roles in and be a target for therapeutic intervention in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide and the pandemic has yet to wane.

429,33326502,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, risk stratification has been used to decide patient eligibility for inpatient, critical and domiciliary care. Here, we sought to validate the MSL-COVID-19 score, originally developed to predict COVID-19 mortality in Mexicans. Also, an adaptation of the formula is proposed for the prediction of COVID-19 severity in a triage setting (Nutri-CoV). METHODS: We included patients evaluated from March 16th to August 17th, 2020 at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion, defining severe COVID-19 as a composite of death, ICU admission or requirement for intubation (n = 3,007). We validated MSL-COVID-19 for prediction of mortality and severe disease. Using Elastic Net Cox regression, we trained (n = 1,831) and validated (n = 1,176) a model for prediction of severe COVID-19 using MSL-COVID-19 along with clinical assessments obtained at a triage setting. RESULTS: The variables included in MSL-COVID-19 are: pneumonia, early onset type 2 diabetes, age > 65 years, chronic kidney disease, any form of immunosuppression, COPD, obesity, diabetes, and age <40 years. MSL-COVID-19 had good performance to predict COVID-19 mortality (c-statistic = 0.722, 95%CI 0.690-0.753) and severity (c-statistic = 0.777, 95%CI 0.753-0.801). The Nutri-CoV score includes the MSL-COVID-19 plus respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry. This tool had better performance in both training (c-statistic = 0.797, 95%CI 0.765-0.826) and validation cohorts (c-statistic = 0.772, 95%CI 0.0.745-0.800) compared to other severity scores.

430,33320904,"BACKGROUND: Cohorts of severely ill patients with COVID-19 have been described in several countries around the globe, but to date there have been few published reports from the United Kingdom (UK). Understanding the characteristics of the affected population admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) in the UK is crucial to inform clinical decision making, research and planning for future waves of infection. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to a large UK ICU from March to May 2020 with follow-up to June 2020. Data were collected from health records using a standardised template. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyse the factors associated with ICU survival. RESULTS: Of the 156 patients included, 112 (72%) were male, 89 (57%) were overweight or obese, 68 (44%) were from ethnic minorities, and 89 (57%) were aged over 60 years of age. 136 (87%) received mechanical ventilation, 77 (57% of those intubated) were placed in the prone position and 95 (70% of those intubated) received neuromuscular blockade. 154 (99%) patients required cardiovascular support and 44 (28%) required renal replacement therapy. Of the 130 patients with completed ICU episodes, 38 (29%) died and 92 (71%) were discharged alive from ICU. In multivariable models, age (OR 1.13 [95% CI 1.07-1.21]), obesity (OR 3.06 [95% CI 1.16-8.74]), lowest P/F ratio on the first day of admission (OR 0.82 [95% CI 0.67-0.98]) and PaCO2 (OR 1.52 [95% CI 1.01-2.39]) were independently associated with ICU death.

432,33296357,"BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) revealed significant constraints in critical care capacity. In anticipation of subsequent waves, reliable prediction of disease severity is essential for critical care capacity management and may enable earlier targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes. The purpose of this study is to develop and externally validate a prognostic model/clinical tool for predicting COVID-19 critical disease at presentation to medical care. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of a prognostic model for the prediction of COVID-19 critical disease where critical disease was defined as ICU admission, ventilation, and/or death. The derivation cohort was used to develop a multivariable logistic regression model. Covariates included patient comorbidities, presenting vital signs, and laboratory values. Model performance was assessed on the validation cohort by concordance statistics. The model was developed with consecutive patients with COVID-19 who presented to University of California Irvine Medical Center in Orange County, California. External validation was performed with a random sample of patients with COVID-19 at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, Georgia. RESULTS: Of a total 3208 patients tested in the derivation cohort, 9% (299/3028) were positive for COVID-19. Clinical data including past medical history and presenting laboratory values were available for 29% (87/299) of patients (median age, 48 years [range, 21-88 years]; 64% [36/55] male). The most common comorbidities included obesity (37%, 31/87), hypertension (37%, 32/87), and diabetes (24%, 24/87). Critical disease was present in 24% (21/87). After backward stepwise selection, the following factors were associated with greatest increased risk of critical disease: number of comorbidities, body mass index, respiratory rate, white blood cell count, % lymphocytes, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, high sensitivity troponin I, ferritin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein. Of a total of 40 patients in the validation cohort (median age, 60 years [range, 27-88 years]; 55% [22/40] male), critical disease was present in 65% (26/40). Model discrimination in the validation cohort was high (concordance statistic: 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.01). A web-based tool was developed to enable clinicians to input patient data and view likelihood of critical disease. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We present a model which accurately predicted COVID-19 critical disease risk using comorbidities and presenting vital signs and laboratory values, on derivation and validation cohorts from two different institutions. If further validated on additional cohorts of patients, this model/clinical tool may provide useful prognostication of critical care needs.","BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) revealed significant constraints in critical care capacity.

Of a total of 40 patients in the validation cohort (median age, 60 years [range, 27-88 years]; 55% [22/40] male), critical disease was present in 65% (26/40). Model discrimination in the validation cohort was high (concordance statistic: 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.87-1.01). A web-based tool was developed to enable clinicians to input patient data and view likelihood of critical disease. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We present a model which accurately predicted COVID-19 critical disease risk using comorbidities and presenting vital signs and laboratory values, on derivation and validation cohorts from two different institutions.

433,33282812,"On March 13, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 a pandemic. Since then the virus has infected over 9.1 million individuals and resulted in over 470,000 deaths worldwide (as of June 24, 2020). Here, we discuss the spatial correlation between county population health rankings and the incidence of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the United States. We analyzed the spread of the disease based on multiple variables at the county level, using publicly available data on the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, intensive care unit beds and socio-demographic, and healthcare resources in the U.S. Our results indicate substantial geographical variations in the distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths across the US counties. There was significant positive global spatial correlation between the percentage of Black Americans and cases of COVID-19 (Moran I = 0.174 and 0.264, p < 0.0001). A similar result was found for the global spatial correlation between the percentage of Black American and deaths due to COVID-19 at the county level in the U.S. (Moran I = 0.264, p < 0.0001). There was no significant spatial correlation between the Hispanic population and COVID-19 cases and deaths; however, a higher percentage of non-Hispanic white was significantly negatively spatially correlated with cases (Moran I = -0.203, p < 0.0001) and deaths (Moran I = -0.137, p < 0.0001) from the disease. This study showed significant but weak spatial autocorrelation between the number of intensive care unit beds and COVID-19 cases (Moran I = 0.08, p < 0.0001) and deaths (Moran I = 0.15, p < 0.0001), respectively. These findings provide more detail into the interplay between the infectious disease and healthcare-related characteristics of the population.

Considering the global prevalence of obesity, exploring relationships with COVID-19 are of clinical importance. The aim was to provide a comprehensive summary and recommendations on this relationship between COVID-19 and obesity. Method: A literature search was performed to prepare a narrative review of COVID-19 and obesity. Results: An obesity state promotes chronic inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, hinders immunity and causes mechanical lung compression. These increase susceptibilities to COVID-19 infection, complications including the requirement of invasive ventilation. Existing co-morbidities enhances these complications. Preventive measures of social distancing and self-isolation may increase stigmatisation and psychological deterrents. Hence, special recommendations targeting this vulnerable population are required.

435,33277388,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 20 million people worldwide, with mortality exceeding 800,000 patients. Risk factors associated with severe disease and mortality include advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.

We hypothesized that dysregulation of LMs may be a defining feature of the severity of COVID-19. By examining LMs and polyunsaturated fatty acid precursor lipids in serum from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we demonstrate that moderate and severe disease are separated by specific differences in abundance of immune-regulatory and proinflammatory LMs. This difference in LM balance corresponded with decreased LM products of ALOX12 and COX2 and an increase LMs products of ALOX5 and cytochrome p450. Given the important immune-regulatory role of LMs, these data provide mechanistic insight into an immuno-lipidomic imbalance in severe COVID-19.","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 20 million people worldwide, with mortality exceeding 800,000 patients.

440,33269116,"Background and aim Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is known to cause a broad spectrum of illnesses. There is evidence that obesity-related conditions may increase the severity of COVID-19 disease, especially in those below the age of 60. However, there has been limited research on mortality rate based on body mass index (BMI) in the older adult population, defined as age over 65. The objective of this study was to characterize outcomes in older adults infected with COVID-19 based on BMI. Study design and methods It is a single-center retrospective cohort study of older adults with COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes assessed were oxygen requirements, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay. Data were analyzed with the Student's t-test, Fisher's exact test, and multiple logistic regression analyses as appropriate. Results A total of 290 patients were included in this study.

There is evidence that obesity-related conditions may increase the severity of COVID-19 disease, especially in those below the age of 60. However, there has been limited research on mortality rate based on body mass index (BMI) in the older adult population, defined as age over 65. The objective of this study was to characterize outcomes in older adults infected with COVID-19 based on BMI. Study design and methods It is a single-center retrospective cohort study of older adults with COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes assessed were oxygen requirements, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay. Data were analyzed with the Student's t-test, Fisher's exact test, and multiple logistic regression analyses as appropriate. Results A total of 290 patients were included in this study. The mean age was 77.6 years. The median BMI was >30 kg/m2. The primary outcome of hospital mortality occurred in 49.7% of patients. BMI was not found to be a predictor of mortality.

441,33267871,"BACKGROUND: Obesity has been widely reported to be associated with the disease progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, some studies have reported different findings. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between obesity and poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies from the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from 1 November 2019 to 24 May 2020 was performed. Study quality was assessed, and data extraction was conducted. The meta-analysis was carried out using fixed-effects and random-effects models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) of several poor outcomes in obese and non-obese COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies (n = 12,591 patients) were included. Pooled analysis demonstrated that body mass index (BMI) was higher in severe/critical COVID-19 patients than in mild COVID-19 patients (MD 2.48 kg/m(2), 95% CI [2.00 to 2.96 kg/m(2)]). Additionally, obesity in COVID-19 patients was associated with poor outcomes (OR = 1.683, 95% CI [1.408-2.011]), which comprised severe COVID-19, ICU care, invasive mechanical ventilation use, and disease progression (OR = 4.17, 95% CI [2.32-7.48]; OR = 1.57, 95% CI [1.18-2.09]; OR = 2.13, 95% CI [1.10-4.14]; OR = 1.41, 95% CI [1.26-1.58], respectively). Obesity as a risk factor was greater in younger patients (OR 3.30 vs. 1.72). However, obesity did not increase the risk of hospital mortality (OR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.32-2.51]). CONCLUSIONS: As a result of a potentially critical role of obesity in determining the severity of COVID-19, it is important to collect anthropometric information for COVID-19 patients, especially the younger group. However, obesity may not be associated with hospital mortality, and efforts to understand the impact of obesity on the mortality of COVID-19 patients should be a research priority in the future.","BACKGROUND: Obesity has been widely reported to be associated with the disease progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, some studies have reported different findings.

METHODS: To describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection, including patients with comorbid respiratory diseases, who have been primarily hospitalized in the pulmonology department of Strasbourg University Hospital, France. In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 3 to April 15, 2020. We then compared the symptoms, biological and radiological findings, and outcomes for patients with and without CLD. RESULTS: Of the 124 patients that were enrolled, the median age was 62 years, and 75 patients (60%) were male. Overall, 40% of patients (n=50) had preexisting CLD, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=15, 12%) and asthma (n=19, 15%). Twenty-eight patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), and six patients died in our unit. CLD were not predictive of ICU hospitalization, but a significantly higher total mortality was observed (17.6% vs. 5.5%, P<0.05) in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the lack of an over-representation of CLD in COVID-19, representing 40% of patients in this cohort and even within a pulmonology department. CLD were not a risk factor for ICU management. However, a tendency to higher global mortality was observed in COVID-19 patients with CLD.

445,33251580,"AIMS: Obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are associated with COVID-19 risk and severity. Because epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) expresses ACE2, we wanted to identify the main factors associated with ACE2 levels and its cleavage enzyme, ADAM17, in epicardial fat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epicardial and subcutaneous fat biopsies were obtained from 43 patients who underwent open-heart surgery. From 36 patients, biopsies were used for RNA expression analysis by real-time PCR of ACE1, ACE2 and ADAM17. From 8 patients, stromal vascular cells were submitted to adipogenesis or used for studying the treatment effects on gene expression levels. Soluble ACE2 was determined in supernatants by ELISA. RESULTS: Epicardial fat biopsies expressed higher levels of ACE2 (1.53 [1.49-1.61] vs 1.51 [1.47-1.56] a.u., P < .05) and lower ADAM17 than subcutaneous fat (1.67 [1.65-1.70] vs 1.70 [1.66-1.74] a.u., P < .001). Both genes were increased in epicardial fat from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (1.62 [1.50-2.28] vs 1.52 [1.49-1.55] a.u., P = .05 for ACE2 and 1.68 [1.66-1.78] vs 1.66 [1.63-1.69] a.u., P < .05 for ADAM17). Logistic regression analysis determined that T2DM was the main associated factor with epicardial ACE2 levels (P < .01). The highest ACE2 levels were found on patients with diabetes and obesity. ACE1 and ACE2 levels were not upregulated by antidiabetic treatment (metformin, insulin or thiazolidinedione).

446,33246009,"BACKGROUND: Excess visceral fat (VF) or high body mass index (BMI) is risk factors for severe COVID-19. The receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is expressed at higher levels in the VF than in the subcutaneous fat (SCF) of obese patients. AIM: To show that visceral fat accumulation better predicts severity of COVID-19 outcome compared to either SCF amounts or BMI. METHODS: We selected patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and a computed tomography (CT) scan. Severe COVID-19 was defined as requirement for mechanical ventilation or death. Fat depots were quantified on abdominal CT scan slices and the measurements were correlated with the clinical outcomes. ACE 2 mRNA levels were quantified in fat depots of a separate group of non-COVID-19 subjects using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: Among 165 patients with a mean BMI of 26.1+/-5.4kg/m(2), VF was associated with severe COVID-19 (p=0.022) and SCF was not (p=0.640). Subcutaneous fat was not different in patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and the SCF/VF ratio was lower in patients with severe COVID-19 (p=0.010). The best predictive value for severe COVID-19 was found for a VF area >/=128.5cm(2) (ROC curve), which was independently associated with COVID-19 severity (p<0.001). In an exploratory analysis, ACE 2 mRNA positively correlated with BMI in VF but not in SCF of non-COVID-19 patients (r(2)=0.27 vs 0.0008). CONCLUSION: Severe forms of COVID-19 are associated with high visceral adiposity in European adults. On the basis of an exploratory analysis ACE 2 in the visceral fat may be a trigger for the cytokine storm, and this needs to be clarified by future studies.","BACKGROUND: Excess visceral fat (VF) or high body mass index (BMI) is risk factors for severe COVID-19.

Subcutaneous fat was not different in patients with mild or severe COVID-19 and the SCF/VF ratio was lower in patients with severe COVID-19 (p=0.010). The best predictive value for severe COVID-19 was found for a VF area >/=128.5cm(2) (ROC curve), which was independently associated with COVID-19 severity (p<0.001). In an exploratory analysis, ACE 2 mRNA positively correlated with BMI in VF but not in SCF of non-COVID-19 patients (r(2)=0.27 vs 0.0008). CONCLUSION: Severe forms of COVID-19 are associated with high visceral adiposity in European adults. On the basis of an exploratory analysis ACE 2 in the visceral fat may be a trigger for the cytokine storm, and this needs to be clarified by future studies.",Favre G, V,Journal Article, BACKGROUND: Excess visceral fat (VF) or high<br>body mass index (BMI) is risk factors for severe<br>COVID-19.

447,33245701,"Exposure to viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens is unavoidable. Yet, the mere presence of these threats is not enough to automatically predispose to illness. The susceptibility of an individual to viral or bacterial infections is dependent upon immune competence. Many factors can interfere with the functioning of the immune system. Epigenetic alterations in the form of lifestyle or environmental factors can lead to impaired immunity. For example, exposure to air pollution can increase the risk of complications and mortality from COVID-19. Obesity can also exacerbate the damaging effects of air pollution on the lungs and may enhance the association between air pollution and increased COVID-19 severity. Poor sleep is another factor leading to impaired immunity, likely due to the coinciding melatonin depletion. Melatonin has been found to have antiviral and immune-enhancing effects, and it has been proposed that this hormone may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients. Zinc and vitamins D and C have also been well studied for their ability to shorten the duration of upper respiratory infections, and vitamin D has been found to reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients. Cannabidiol can both directly and indirectly improve immunity by enhancing natural killer cell activity, reducing inflammation, and relieving stress. Other dietary supplements backed by solid scientific evidence to show they act as immune enhancers are astragalus, a yeast fermentate (EpiCor(R)), olive leaf extract, berberine, N-acetyl cysteine, and garlic.","Exposure to viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens is unavoidable.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between prior metabolic surgery and the severity of COVID-19 in patients with severe obesity. SETTING: Cleveland Clinic Health System in the United States. METHODS: Among 4365 patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between March 8, 2020 and July 22, 2020 in the Cleveland Clinic Health System, 33 patients were identified who had a prior history of metabolic surgery. The surgical patients were propensity matched 1:10 to nonsurgical patients to assemble a cohort of control patients (n = 330) with a body mass index (BMI) >/= 40 kg/m(2) at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing. The primary endpoint was the rate of hospital admission. The exploratory endpoints included admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation and dialysis during index hospitalization, and mortality. After propensity score matching, outcomes were compared in univariate and multivariate regression models. RESULTS: The average BMI of the surgical group was 49.1 +/- 8.8 kg/m(2) before metabolic surgery and was down to 37.2 +/- 7.1 at the time of SARS-CoV-2 testing, compared with the control group's BMI of 46.7 +/- 6.4 kg/m(2). In the univariate analysis, 6 (18.2%) patients in the metabolic surgery group and 139 (42.1%) patients in the control group were admitted to the hospital (P = .013). In the multivariate analysis, a prior history of metabolic surgery was associated with a lower hospital admission rate compared with control patients with obesity (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.88; P = .028). While none of the 4 exploratory outcomes occurred in the metabolic surgery group, 43 (13.0%) patients in the control group required ICU admission (P = .021), 22 (6.7%) required mechanical ventilation, 5 (1.5%) required dialysis, and 8 (2.4%) patients died. CONCLUSION: Prior metabolic surgery with subsequent weight loss and improvement of metabolic abnormalities was associated with lower rates of hospital and ICU admission in patients with obesity who became infected with SARS-CoV-2.

452,33231487,"BACKGROUND: Speculations whether treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) predisposes to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or worsens its outcomes. This study assessed the association of ACE-I/ARB therapy with the development of severe COVID-19. METHODS: This multi-center, prospective study enrolled patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and receiving one or more antihypertensive agents to manage either hypertension or cardiovascular disease. ACE-I/ARB therapy associations with severe COVID-19 on the day of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death on follow-up were tested using a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for age, obesity, and chronic illnesses. The composite outcome of mechanical ventilation and death was examined using the adjusted Cox multivariate regression model. RESULTS: Of 338 enrolled patients, 245 (72.4%) were using ACE-I/ARB on the day of hospital admission, and 197 continued ACE-I/ARB therapy during hospitalization. Ninety-eight (29%) patients had a severe COVID-19, which was not significantly associated with the use of ACE-I/ARB (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.66-2.09; P = .57). Prehospitalization ACE-I/ARB therapy was not associated with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. Continuing ACE-I/ARB therapy during hospitalization was associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.073-0.67; P = .008).

454,33228225,"SARS-CoV-2 induced the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, the most significant medical challenge in the last century. COVID-19 is associated with notable increases in morbidity and death worldwide. Preexisting conditions, like cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, are correlated with higher severity and a significant increase in the fatality rate of COVID-19. COVID-19 induces multiple cardiovascular complexities, such as cardiac arrest, myocarditis, acute myocardial injury, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias and, subsequently, heart failure (HF). The precise mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 may cause myocardial complications are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury based on current knowledge are the direct viral entry of the virus and damage to the myocardium, systemic inflammation, hypoxia, cytokine storm, interferon-mediated immune response, and plaque destabilization. The virus enters the cell through the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and plays a central function in the virus's pathogenesis. A systematic understanding of cardiovascular effects of SARS-CoV2 is needed to develop novel therapeutic tools to target the virus-induced cardiac damage as a potential strategy to minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system and reduce the morbidity. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of COVID-19 mediated damage to the cardiovascular system.","SARS-CoV-2 induced the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, the most significant medical challenge in the last century.

455,33227520,"OBJECTIVE: There is limited information on the severity of COVID-19 infection in children with comorbidities. We investigated the effects of pediatric comorbidities on COVID-19 severity by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Medline databases were searched for publications on pediatric COVID-19 infections published January 1(st) to October 5(th), 2020. Articles describing at least one child with and without comorbidities, COVID-19 infection, and reported outcomes were included. RESULTS: 42 studies containing 275,661 children without comorbidities and 9,353 children with comorbidities were included. Severe COVID-19 was present in 5.1% of children with comorbidities, and in 0.2% without comorbidities. Random-effects analysis revealed a higher risk of severe COVID-19 among children with comorbidities than for healthy children; relative risk ratio 1.79 (95% CI 1.27 - 2.51; I(2) = 94%). Children with underlying conditions also had a higher risk of COVID-19-associated mortality; relative risk ratio 2.81 (95% CI 1.31 - 6.02; I(2) = 82%). Children with obesity had a relative risk ratio of 2.87 (95% CI 1.16 - 7.07; I(2) = 36%).

457,33224915,"Throughout history, the human race has often faced pandemics with substantial numbers of fatalities. As the COVID-19 pandemic has now affected the whole planet, even countries with moderate to strong healthcare support and expenditure have struggled to contain disease transmission and casualties. Countries affected by COVID-19 have different demographics, socioeconomic, and lifestyle health indicators. In this context, it is important to find out to what extent these parametric variations are modulating disease outcomes. To answer this, this study selected demographic, socioeconomic, and health indicators e.g., population density, percentage of the urban population, median age, health expenditure per capita, obesity, diabetes prevalence, alcohol intake, tobacco use, case fatality of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as independent variables. Countries were grouped according to these variables and influence on dependent variables e.g., COVID-19 positive tests, case fatality, and case recovery rates were statistically analyzed. The results suggested that countries with variable median age had a significantly different outcome on positive test rate (P < 0.01). Both the median age (P = 0.0397) and health expenditure per capita (P = 0.0041) showed a positive relation with case recovery. An increasing number of tests per 100 K of the population showed a positive and negative relationship with the number of positives per 100 K population (P = 0.0001) and the percentage of positive tests (P < 0.0001), respectively. Alcohol intake per capita in liter (P = 0.0046), diabetes prevalence (P = 0.0389), and NCDs mortalities (P = 0.0477) also showed a statistical relation to the case fatality rate. Further analysis revealed that countries with high healthcare expenditure along with high median age and increased urban population showed more case fatality but also had a better recovery rate. Investment in the health sector alone is insufficient in controlling the severity of the pandemic. Intelligent and sustainable healthcare both in urban and rural settings and healthy lifestyle acquired immunity may reduce disease transmission and comorbidity induced fatalities, respectively.","Throughout history, the human race has often faced pandemics with substantial numbers of fatalities.

461,33211135,"PURPOSE: To describe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) severity, ventilation management, and the outcomes of ICU patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and to determine risk factors of 90-day mortality post-ICU admission. METHODS: COVID-ICU is a multi-center, prospective cohort study conducted in 138 hospitals in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. Demographic, clinical, respiratory support, adjunctive interventions, ICU length-of-stay, and survival data were collected. RESULTS: From February 25 to May 4, 2020, 4643 patients (median [IQR] age 63 [54-71] years and SAPS II 37 [28-50]) were admitted in ICU, with day-90 post-ICU admission status available for 4244. On ICU admission, standard oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, and non-invasive ventilation were applied to 29%, 19%, and 6% patients, respectively. 2635 (63%) patients were intubated during the first 24 h whereas overall 3376 (80%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) at one point during their ICU stay. Median (IQR) positive end-expiratory and plateau pressures were 12 (10-14) cmH2O, and 24 (21-27) cmH2O, respectively. The mechanical power transmitted by the MV to the lung was 26.5 (18.6-34.9) J/min. Paralyzing agents and prone position were applied to 88% and 70% of patients intubated at Day-1, respectively. Pulmonary embolism and ventilator-associated pneumonia were diagnosed in 207 (9%) and 1209 (58%) of these patients. On day 90, 1298/4244 (31%) patients had died. Among patients who received invasive or non-invasive ventilation on the day of ICU admission, day-90 mortality increased with the severity of ARDS at ICU admission (30%, 34%, and 50% for mild, moderate, and severe ARDS, respectively) and decreased from 42 to 25% over the study period. Early independent predictors of 90-day mortality were older age, immunosuppression, severe obesity, diabetes, higher renal and cardiovascular SOFA score components, lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio and a shorter time between first symptoms and ICU admission. CONCLUSION: Among more than 4000 critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to our ICUs, 90-day mortality was 31% and decreased from 42 to 25% over the study period. Mortality was higher in older, diabetic, obese and severe ARDS patients.","PURPOSE: To describe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) severity, ventilation management, and the outcomes of ICU patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and to determine risk factors of 90-day mortality post-ICU admission.

464,33200953,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed longstanding racial and ethnic inequities in health risks and outcomes in the United States. We aimed to identify racial and ethnic differences in presentation and outcomes for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: The American Heart Association COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is a retrospective observational registry capturing consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We present data on the first 7868 patients by race/ethnicity treated at 88 hospitals across the United States between January 17, 2020, and July 22, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure) and COVID-19 cardiorespiratory ordinal severity score (worst to best: death, cardiac arrest, mechanical ventilation with mechanical circulatory support, mechanical ventilation with vasopressors/inotrope support, mechanical ventilation without hemodynamic support, and hospitalization alone. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between race/ethnicity and each outcome adjusting for differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and presentation features, and accounting for clustering by hospital. RESULTS: Among 7868 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 33.0% were Hispanic, 25.5% were non-Hispanic Black, 6.3% were Asian, and 35.2% were non-Hispanic White. Hispanic and Black patients were younger than non-Hispanic White and Asian patients and were more likely to be uninsured. Black patients had the highest prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. Black patients also had the highest rates of mechanical ventilation (23.2%) and renal replacement therapy (6.6%) but the lowest rates of remdesivir use (6.1%). Overall mortality was 18.4% with 53% of all deaths occurring in Black and Hispanic patients. The adjusted odds ratios for mortality were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.76-1.14) for Black patients, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.73-1.11) for Hispanic patients, and 1.31 (95% CI, 0.96-1.80) for Asian patients compared with non-Hispanic White patients. The median odds ratio across hospitals was 1.99 (95% CI, 1.74-2.48). Results were similar for major adverse cardiovascular events. Asian patients had the highest COVID-19 cardiorespiratory severity at presentation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.16-1.90]). CONCLUSIONS: Although in-hospital mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events did not differ by race/ethnicity after adjustment, Black and Hispanic patients bore a greater burden of mortality and morbidity because of their disproportionate representation among COVID-19 hospitalizations.","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed longstanding racial and ethnic inequities in health risks and outcomes in the United States.

We aimed to describe rates and characterize predictors and health outcomes associated with AKI in a national cohort of US veterans hospitalized with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In a cohort of 5216 US veterans hospitalized with COVID-19 identified through July 23, 2020, we described changes in serum creatinine and examined predictors of AKI and the associations between AKI, health resource utilization, and death, utilizing logistic regressions. We characterized geographic and temporal variations in AKI rates and estimated variance explained by key variables utilizing Poisson regressions. RESULTS: In total, 1655 (32%) participants had AKI; 961 (58%), 223 (13%), and 270 (16%) met Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definitions of stage 1, 2, and 3 AKI, respectively, and 201 (12%) received KRT. Eight percent of participants had AKI within 1 day of hospitalization, and 47% did not recover to baseline serum creatinine by discharge. Older age, Black race, male gender, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and lower eGFR were significant predictors of AKI during hospitalization with COVID-19. AKI was associated with higher mechanical ventilation use (odds ratio, 6.46; 95% confidence interval, 5.52 to 7.57) and longer hospital stay (5.56 additional days; 95% confidence interval, 4.78 to 6.34). AKI was also associated with higher risk of death (odds ratio, 6.71; 95% confidence interval, 5.62 to 8.04); this association was stronger in Blacks (P value of interaction <0.001). Hospital-level rates of AKI exhibited substantial geographic variability, ranging from 10% to 56%. Between March and July 2020, AKI rates declined from 40% to 27%; proportions of AKI stage 3 and AKI requiring KRT decreased from 44% to 17%. Both geographic and temporal variabilities were predominately explained by percentages of Blacks (31% and 49%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: AKI is common during hospitalization with COVID-19 and associated with higher risk of health care resource utilization and death. Nearly half of patients with AKI did not recover to baseline by discharge. Substantial geographic variation and temporal decline in rates and severity of AKI were observed.

466,33197493,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the demographic and clinical features of pediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) syndromes and identify admission variables predictive of disease severity. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, and prospective study of pediatric patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infections and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at 8 sites in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. RESULTS: We identified 281 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections and divided them into 3 groups based on clinical features. Overall, 143 (51%) had respiratory disease, 69 (25%) had MIS-C, and 69 (25%) had other manifestations including gastrointestinal illness or fever. Patients with MIS-C were more likely to identify as non-Hispanic black compared with patients with respiratory disease (35% vs 18%, P = .02). Seven patients (2%) died and 114 (41%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. In multivariable analyses, obesity (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.26-9.10, P = .02) and hypoxia on admission (OR 4.01; 95% CI 1.14-14.15; P = .03) were predictive of severe respiratory disease. Lower absolute lymphocyte count (OR 8.33 per unit decrease in 10(9) cells/L, 95% CI 2.32-33.33, P = .001) and greater C-reactive protein (OR 1.06 per unit increase in mg/dL, 95% CI 1.01-1.12, P = .017) were predictive of severe MIS-C. Race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status were not predictive of disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: We identified variables at the time of hospitalization that may help predict the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease manifestations in children and youth. These variables may have implications for future prognostic tools that inform hospital admission and clinical management.","OBJECTIVE: To characterize the demographic and clinical features of pediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) syndromes and identify admission variables predictive of disease severity.

The patients developed severe symptoms and were admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) to receive invasive ventilation due to diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study composed of elderly (age >/= 60 years) admitted to the ICU. Were collected demographic (sex, age), anthropometric data, presence of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, lung, neurological and oncological diseases), severity score in ICU (SAPS III), PaO2/FiO2 ratio, analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum dosage of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25 OHD) in the first day of hospitalization to identify elderly with hypovitaminosis D (low values < 30 ng/mL). The diagnosis of obesity in elderly was determined by calculating the body mass index (BMI) >/= 30 kg/m(2). RESULTS: A total of 176 elderly met the inclusion criteria. 54% were elderly men and mean age of 72.9 +/- 9.1 years. The median BMI was 30.5 (28.1-33) kg/m(2) with 68.7% having a nutritional diagnosis of obesity and 15.3% had BMI >/= 35 kg/m(2). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (72.2%) and diabetes (40.9%). Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D with values of 25 OHD <30 ng/mL, < 20 ng/mL and <10 ng/mL was 93.8%, 65.9% and 21% respectively. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (<30 ng/mL) in obese elderly was 94.2%. There was a negative and significant bivariate correlation between BMI and levels of 25 OHD (r = - 0.15; p = 0.04).

475,33164230,"The onset of human disease by infection with SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 has revealed risk factors for disease severity. There are four identified factors that put one at high risk for infection and/or mortality creating a disparity: age, co-morbidities, race/ethnicity and gender. Data indicate that the older a person is, and/or the presence of obesity and diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease place one at higher risk for COVID-19.

Hypercoagulopathy and hypofibrinolysis coexist and are detected by viscoelastic tests. These features, when associated with immobilization and intrinsic risk factors (age, obesity, comorbidities, drugs) of the patient, can trigger thromboembolic events, despite thromboprophylaxis. The lungs are the first and most severely damaged organ. To date, most patients have exhibited hypercoagulability on viscoelastic tests not detected by standard coagulation tests. A high rate of thrombotic events was reported, suggesting that it should be considered as a cause of clinical deterioration in intensive care and potentially other clinical settings. In advanced stage, COVID-19 associated coagulopathy, fibrinogen and platelet count can decrease significantly, depending on the severity of clinical status resembling consumptive coagulopathy. In this stage, bleeding events can occur, especially if the patient is under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Viscoelastic tests are very useful tools to assess hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis (not detectable by standard coagulation tests) in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients with COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and look like very promising tools for anticoagulation management. However, further research needs to be carried out to determine whether abnormal viscoelastic tests alone or in combination with other clinical or laboratory findings can identify patients at increased thrombotic risk.

The COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than 46.4 million people, with 1,199,727 deaths. The immune system plays a crucial role in the severity of COVID-19 and the development of pneumonia-induced acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Along with providing protection, both innate and T cell-based adaptive immune response dysregulate during severe SARS-CoV2 infection. This dysregulation is more pronounced in older population and patients with comorbidities (Diabetes, hypertension, obesity, other pulmonary and autoimmune diseases). However, COVID-19 patients develop protective antibodies (Abs) against SARS-CoV2, but they do not long for last. The induction of the immune response against the pathogen also requires metabolic energy that generates through the process of immunometabolism. The change in the metabolic stage of immune cells from homeostasis to an inflammatory or infectious environment is called immunometabolic reprogramming. The article describes the cellular immunology (macrophages, T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, NK cells and pulmonary epithelial cells (PEC) and vascular endothelial cells) and the associated immune response during COVID-19.

However, unlike influenza and other viruses, the disease burden of COVID-19 in patients with asthma has been less evident. OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of COVID-19 in patients with asthma. METHODS: Using big-data analytics and artificial intelligence through the SAVANA Manager clinical platform, we analysed clinical data from patients with asthma from January 1 to May 10, 2020. RESULTS: Out of 71 182 patients with asthma, 1006 (1.41%) suffered from COVID-19. Compared to asthmatic individuals without COVID-19, patients with asthma and COVID-19 were significantly older (55 versus 42 years), predominantly female (66% versus 59%), smoked more frequently and had higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidaemias, diabetes and obesity. Allergy-related factors such as rhinitis and eczema were less common in asthmatic patients with COVID-19 (p<0.001). In addition, higher prevalence of these comorbidities was observed in patients with COVID-19 who required hospital admission. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was lower in patients who required hospitalisation due to COVID-19, as compared to non-hospitalised patients (48.3% versus 61.5%; OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.77). Although patients treated with biologics (n=865; 1.21%) showed increased severity and more comorbidities at the ear, nose and throat level, COVID-19-related hospitalisations in these patients were relatively low (0.23%).

480,33147319,"BACKGROUND: Reports suggest that some persons previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lack detectable immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We aimed to determine the proportion IgG seronegative and predictors for seronegativity among persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We analyzed serologic data collected from healthcare workers and first responders in New York City and the Detroit metropolitan area with a history of a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result and who were tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at least 2 weeks after symptom onset. RESULTS: Of 2547 persons with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 160 (6.3%) were seronegative. Of 2112 previously symptomatic persons, the proportion seronegative slightly increased from 14 to 90 days post symptom onset (P = .06). The proportion seronegative ranged from 0% among 79 persons previously hospitalized to 11.0% among 308 persons with asymptomatic infections. In a multivariable model, persons who took immunosuppressive medications were more likely to be seronegative (31.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.7%-64.7%), while participants of non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic White; 2.7%; 95% CI, 1.5%-4.8%), with severe obesity (vs under/normal weight; 3.9%; 95% CI, 1.7%-8.6%), or with more symptoms were less likely to be seronegative. CONCLUSIONS: In our population with previous RT-PCR-confirmed infection, approximately 1 in 16 persons lacked IgG antibodies.

482,33133024,"Covid-19 is a recently-emerged infectious disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV2. SARS-CoV2 differs from previous coronavirus infections (SARS and MERS) due to its high infectivity (reproduction value, R0, typically 2-4) and pre- or asymptomatic transmission, properties that have contributed to the current global Covid-19 pandemic. Identified risk factors for disease severity and death from SARS-Cov2 infection include older age, male sex, diabetes, obesity and hypertension. The reasons for these associations are still largely obscure. Evidence is also emerging that SARS-CoV2 infection exacerbates the underlying pathophysiology of hyperglycemia in people with diabetes. Here, we discuss potential mechanisms through which diabetes may affect the risk of more severe outcomes in Covid-19 and, additionally, how diabetic emergencies and longer term pathology may be aggravated by infection with the virus. We consider roles for the immune system, the observed phenomenon of microangiopathy in severe Covid-19 infection and the potential for direct viral toxicity on metabolically-relevant tissues including pancreatic beta cells and targets of insulin action.","Covid-19 is a recently-emerged infectious disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV2.

483,33129597,"BACKGROUND: The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic is unprecedented in its impact. It is essential to shed light on patient characteristics that predispose to a more severe disease course. Obesity, defined as a BMI>30 kg/m(2), is suggested to be one of these characteristics. However, BMI does not differentiate between fat mass and lean body mass, or the distribution of fat tissue. The aim of the present study was to assess the body composition of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ward or the ICU and identify any associations with severity of disease. METHODS: We performed an observational cross-sectional cohort study. Bioelectric impedance analysis was conducted amongst all confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the ward or ICU of our hospital in the Netherlands, between April 10 and 17, 2020. Body water measurements and derived values were recalculated to dry weight, using a standard ratio of extracellular water to total body water of 0.38. Data were compared between the ward and ICU patients, and regression models were used to assess the associations between baseline characteristics, body composition, and several indicators of disease severity, including a composite score composed of mortality, morbidity, and ICU admission. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included, of which 30 in the ward and 24 in the ICU. The mean age was 67 years (95%-CI 64-71), and 34 (63%) were male. Mean BMI was 29.7 (95%-CI 28.2-31.1) kg/m(2) and did not differ between groups. Body composition values were not independently associated with disease severity. In multiple logistic regression analyses, a low phase angle was associated with COVID-19 severity in the composite score (OR 0.299, p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: We found no significant associations between body composition, including fat mass, visceral fat area, and fat-free mass, and disease severity in our population of generally overweight COVID-19 patients. A lower phase angle did increase the odds of severe COVID-19. We believe that factors other than body composition play a more critical role in the development of severe COVID-19.","BACKGROUND: The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic is unprecedented in its impact.

In three months, there were 208 discrete women tested and 23 (11.1%) who were positive for COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was 5.1% in asymptomatic women being screened upon admission to the hospital. There was a high prevalence of obesity (68.2%) and other comorbid conditions (43.5%) in this population, and all patients were racial/ethnic minorities. Despite these risk factors, the patients uniformly had either mild or asymptomatic disease. No symptomatic patients required hospitalization for their infection.

485,33128218,"INTRODUCTION: On February 20, 2020, a severe case of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed in northern Italy (Lombardy). Some studies have identified obesity as a risk factor for severe disease in patients with COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its severity in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During the lockdown period (until May 2020), we contacted operated patients by phone and social networks (e.g., Facebook) to maintain constant contact with them; in addition, we gave the patients a dedicated phone number at which to call us for emergencies. We produced telemedicine and educational videos for obese and bariatric patients, and we submitted a questionnaire to patients who had undergone bariatric surgery in the past. RESULTS: A total of 2145 patients (313 male; 1832 female) replied to the questionnaire. Mean presurgical BMI: 44.5 +/- 6.8 kg/m(2). Mean age: 44.0 +/- 10.0 year. Mean BMI after surgery: 29.3 +/- 5.5 kg/m(2) (p < 0.05). From February to May 2020, 8.4% of patients reported that they suffered from at least one symptom among those identified as related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirteen patients (0.6%) tested positive for COVID-19. Six patients (0.3%) were admitted to the COVID Department, and 2 patients (0.1%) were admitted to the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Although the reported rates of symptoms and fever were high, only 0.6% of patients tested positive for COVID-19. Among more than 2000 patients who underwent bariatric surgery analyzed in this study, only 0.1% needed ICU admission.","INTRODUCTION: On February 20, 2020, a severe case of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed in northern Italy (Lombardy).

486,33124541,"We studied sources of variation between countries in per-capita mortality from COVID-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus). Potential predictors of per-capita coronavirus-related mortality in 200 countries by May 9, 2020 were examined, including age, gender, obesity prevalence, temperature, urbanization, smoking, duration of the outbreak, lockdowns, viral testing, contact-tracing policies, and public mask-wearing norms and policies. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed. In univariate analysis, the prevalence of smoking, per-capita gross domestic product, urbanization, and colder average country temperature were positively associated with coronavirus-related mortality. In a multivariable analysis of 196 countries, the duration of the outbreak in the country, and the proportion of the population aged 60 years or older were positively associated with per-capita mortality, whereas duration of mask-wearing by the public was negatively associated with mortality (all P < 0.001). Obesity and less stringent international travel restrictions were independently associated with mortality in a model which controlled for testing policy. Viral testing policies and levels were not associated with mortality. Internal lockdown was associated with a nonsignificant 2.4% reduction in mortality each week (P = 0.83). The association of contact-tracing policy with mortality was not statistically significant (P = 0.06). In countries with cultural norms or government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita coronavirus mortality increased on average by just 16.2% each week, as compared with 61.9% each week in remaining countries.

This virus pandemic has turned more complicated as individuals with co-morbidities like diabetes, cardiovascular conditions and obesity are at a high risk of acquiring infection and suffering from a more severe course of disease. Prolonged viral infection and obesity are independently known to lower the immune response and a combination can thus result in a ""cytokine storm"" and a substantial weakening of the immune system. With the rise in obesity cases globally, the chances that obese individuals will acquire infection and need hospitalization are heightened. In this review, we discuss why obesity, a low-grade chronic inflammation, contributes toward the increased severity in COVID-19 patients. We suggest that increased inflammation, activation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, elevated adipokines and higher ectopic fat may be the factors contributing to the disease severity, in particular deteriorating the cardiovascular and lung function, in obese individuals. We look at the many lessons learnt from the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic and relate it to the very little but fast incoming information that is available from the SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with overweight and obesity.","From the beginning of 2020, the governments and the health systems around the world are tackling infections and fatalities caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) resulting in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study among all French expert centers for neuromyelitis optica and related disorders. Patients with NMOSD or MOGAD included in the study received a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2020. Main outcome was COVID-19 severity score assessed on a seven-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 (not hospitalized with no limitations on activities) to 7 (death). RESULTS: Fifteen cases (mean [SD] age: 39.3 [14.3] years, 11 female) were included. Five patients (33.3%) were hospitalized, all receiving rituximab. A 24-year-old patient with positive aquaporine-4 antibody, with obesity as comorbidity, needed mechanical ventilation. Outpatients were receiving anti-CD20 (5), mycophenolate mofetil (3) or azathioprine (3).

METHODS: Data on candidate risk factors were extracted from patients' last checkup records. Propensity score-matched cohorts were constructed, and logistic regression models were used to adjust for age, sex, and comorbidities. The primary outcome was death or severe COVID-19, defined as requiring supplementary oxygen or higher ventilatory support. RESULTS: Among 7,649 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 2,231 (29.2%) received checkups and severe COVID-19 occurred in 307 patients (13.8%).

None of the studies have reported the outcomes of in-hospital cardiac arrest in coronavirus disease 2019 patients in the United States. We describe the characteristics and outcomes of in-hospital cardiac arrest in coronavirus disease 2019 patients in rural Southwest Georgia. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Single-center, multihospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive coronavirus disease 2019 patients who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrest with attempted resuscitation. INTERVENTIONS: Attempted resuscitation with advanced cardiac life support. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Out of 1,094 patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 during the study period, 63 patients suffered from in-hospital cardiac arrest with attempted resuscitation and were included in this study. The median age was 66 years, and 49.2% were males. The majority of patients were African Americans (90.5%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (88.9%), obesity (69.8%), diabetes (60.3%), and chronic kidney disease (33.3%). Eighteen patients (28.9%) had a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 0-2. The most common presenting symptoms were shortness of breath (63.5%), fever (52.4%), and cough (46%). The median duration of symptoms prior to admission was 14 days. During hospital course, 66.7% patients developed septic shock, and 84.1% had acute respiratory distress syndrome. Prior to in-hospital cardiac arrest, 81% were on ventilator, 60.3% were on vasopressors, and 39.7% were on dialysis. The majority of in-hospital cardiac arrest (84.1%) occurred in the ICU. Time to initiation of advanced cardiac life support protocol was less than 1 minute for all in-hospital cardiac arrest in the ICU and less than 2 minutes for the remaining patients. The most common initial rhythms were pulseless electrical activity (58.7%) and asystole (33.3%). Although return of spontaneous circulation was achieved in 29% patients, it was brief in all of them.

492,33083782,"As Covid-19 affects millions of people worldwide, the global health care will encounter an increasing burden of the aftermaths of the disease. Evidence shows that up to a fifth of the patients develop fibrotic tissue in the lung. The SARS outbreak in the early 2000 resulted in chronic pulmonary fibrosis in a subset (around 4%) of the patients, and correlated to reduced lung function and forced expiratory volume (FEV). The similarities between corona virus infections causing SARS and Covid-19 are striking, except that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has proven to have an even higher communicability. This would translate into a large number of patients seeking care for clinical signs of pulmonary fibrosis, given that the Covid-19 pandemic has up till now (Sept 2020) affected around 30 million people. The SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Downregulation of ACE2 upon virus binding disturbs downstream activities of RAS resulting in increased inflammation and development of fibrosis. The poor prognosis and risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis are therefore associated with the increased expression of ACE2 in risk groups, such as obesity, heart disorders and aging, conferring plenty of binding opportunity for the virus and subsequently the internalization of ACE2, thus devoiding the enzyme from acting counter-inflammatory and antifibrotic. Identifying pathways that are associated with Covid-19 severity that result in pulmonary fibrosis may enable early diagnosis and individualized treatment for these patients to prevent or reduce irreversible fibrotic damage to the lung.","As Covid-19 affects millions of people worldwide, the global health care will encounter an increasing burden of the aftermaths of the disease.

495,33066495,"Infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of a new disease (COVID-19). The risk of severe COVID-19 is increased by certain underlying comorbidities, including asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Notably, exposure to hormonally active chemicals called endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can promote such cardio-metabolic diseases, endocrine-related cancers, and immune system dysregulation and thus, may also be linked to higher risk of severe COVID-19. Bisphenol A (BPA) is among the most common EDCs and exerts its effects via receptors which are widely distributed in human tissues, including nuclear oestrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta), membrane-bound oestrogen receptor (G protein-coupled receptor 30; GPR30), and human nuclear receptor oestrogen-related receptor gamma. As such, this paper focuses on the potential role of BPA in promoting comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19, as well as on potential BPA-induced effects on key SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Interestingly, GPR30 appears to exhibit greater co-localisation with TMPRSS2 in key tissues like lung and prostate, suggesting that BPA exposure may impact on the local expression of these SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators. Overall, the potential role of BPA on the risk and severity of COVID-19 merits further investigation.","Infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of a new disease (COVID-19).

496,33064734,"Clinical spectrum of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear, especially with regard to the presence of pneumonia. We aimed to describe the clinical course and final outcomes of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the full spectrum of disease severity. We also aimed to identify potential predictive factors for COVID-19 pneumonia. We conducted a retrospective study among adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand, between January 8 and April 16, 2020. One-hundred-and-ninety-three patients were included. The median (IQR) age was 37.0 (29.0-53.0) years, and 58.5% were male. The median (IQR) incubation period was 5.5 (3.0-8.0) days. More than half (56%) of the patients were mild disease severity, 22% were moderate, 14% were severe, and 3% were critical. Asymptomatic infection was found in 5%. The final clinical outcomes in 189 (97.9%) were recovered and 4 (2.1%) were deceased. The incidence of pneumonia was 39%. The median (IQR) time from onset of illness to pneumonia detection was 7.0 (5.0-9.0) days. Bilateral pneumonia was more prevalent than unilateral pneumonia.

497,33063447,"BACKGROUND: The liberal administration of hydroxychloroquine-sulphate (HCQ) to COVID-19 patients has raised concern regarding the risk of QTc prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias, particularly when prescribed with azithromycin. We evaluated the incidence of QTc prolongation among moderately and severely ill COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ and of the existence of concomitant alternative causes. METHODS: All COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ (between Mar 1 and Apr 14, 2020) in a tertiary medical centre were included. Clinical characteristics and relevant risk factors were collected from the electronic medical records. Individual patient QTc intervals were determined before and after treatment with HCQ. The primary outcome measure sought was a composite end point comprised of either an increase >/=60 milliseconds (ms) in the QTc interval compared with pre-treatment QTc, and/or a maximal QTc interval >500 ms RESULTS: Ninety patients were included. Median age was 65 years (IQR 55-75) and 57 (63%) were male. Thirty-nine patients (43%) were severely or critically ill. Hypertension and obesity were common (n = 23 each, 26%). QTc prolongation evolved in 14 patients (16%). Age >65 years, congestive heart failure, severity of disease, C-reactive protein level, hypokalaemia and furosemide treatment, were all associated with QTc prolongation. Adjusted analysis showed that QTc prolongation was five times more likely with hypokalaemia [OR 5, (95% CI, 1.3-20)], and three times more likely with furosemide treatment [OR 3 (95% CI, 1.01-13.7)]. CONCLUSION: In patients treated with HCQ, QTc prolongation was associated with the presence of traditional risk factors such as hypokalaemia and furosemide treatment.","BACKGROUND: The liberal administration of hydroxychloroquine-sulphate (HCQ) to COVID-19 patients has raised concern regarding the risk of QTc prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias, particularly when prescribed with azithromycin.

Non-clinical sociodemographic features are important explanatory variables of COVID-19 outcomes, revealing existing disparities in large health care systems. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We use nation-wide multicenter data of COVID-19 patients in Brazil to predict mortality and ventilator usage. The dataset contains hospitalized patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and had either recovered or were deceased between March 1 and June 30, 2020. A total of 113,214 patients with 50,387 deceased, were included. Both interpretable (sparse versions of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines) and state-of-the-art non-interpretable (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Random Forest) classification methods are employed. Death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with demographics, socioeconomic factors, and comorbidities. Variables highly predictive of mortality included geographic location of the hospital (OR = 2.2 for Northeast region, OR = 2.1 for North region); renal (OR = 2.0) and liver (OR = 1.7) chronic disease; immunosuppression (OR = 1.7); obesity (OR = 1.7); neurological (OR = 1.6), cardiovascular (OR = 1.5), and hematologic (OR = 1.2) disease; diabetes (OR = 1.4); chronic pneumopathy (OR = 1.4); immunosuppression (OR = 1.3); respiratory symptoms, ranging from respiratory discomfort (OR = 1.4) and dyspnea (OR = 1.3) to oxygen saturation less than 95% (OR = 1.7); hospitalization in a public hospital (OR = 1.2); and self-reported patient illiteracy (OR = 1.1). Validation accuracies (AUC) for predicting mortality and ventilation need reach 79% and 70%, respectively, when using only pre-admission variables. Models that use post-admission disease progression information reach accuracies (AUC) of 86% and 87% for predicting mortality and ventilation use, respectively.

Study Design: This is a case series of pregnant and postpartum women who received positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between March 3, 2020, and May 11, 2020, within 3 hospitals of the Yale New Haven Health delivery network. Charts were reviewed for basic sociodemographic and prepregnancy characteristics, coronavirus disease 2019 course, laboratory values, and pregnancy outcomes. Results: Of the 1567 tested pregnant and postpartum women between March 3, 2020, and May 11, 2020, 9% (n=141) had a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 result. Hispanic women were overrepresented in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive group (n=61; 43.8%). In addition, Hispanic ethnicity was associated with a higher rate of moderate and severe diseases than non-Hispanic (18% [11/61] vs 3.8% [3/78], respectively; odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-20.7; P=.01). Of note, 44 women (31.2%) were asymptomatic, 37 of whom (26.2%) were diagnosed on universal screening upon admission for delivery. Moreover, 59% (n=83) were diagnosed before delivery, 36% (n=51) upon presentation for childbirth, and 5% (n=7) after delivery. Severe disease was diagnosed in 6 cases (4.3%), and there was 1 maternal death. Obese women were more likely to develop moderate and severe diseases than nonobese women (16.4% [9/55] vs 3.8% [3/79]; odds ratio, 4.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-19.25; P=.02). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were diagnosed in 22.3% of women (17/77) who delivered after 20 weeks' gestation. Higher levels of C-reactive protein during antepartum coronavirus disease 2019-related admission were more common in women with worse clinical course; however, this association did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy may result in severe disease and death.

Obese women were more likely to develop moderate and severe diseases than nonobese women (16.4% [9/55] vs 3.8% [3/79]; odds ratio, 4.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-19.25; P=.02). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were diagnosed in 22.3% of women (17/77) who delivered after 20 weeks' gestation. Higher levels of C-reactive protein during antepartum coronavirus disease 2019-related admission were more common in women with worse clinical course; however, this association did not reach statistical significance.

504,33045426,"Obesity is a risk factor for disease severity in individuals with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, the increased susceptibility of this population to COVID-19 is unclear. We outline several underlying mechanisms that may explain the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 severity. Obesity has an adverse effect on respiratory physiology because increased intra-abdominal adipose tissue can interfere with lung expansion, resulting in reduced lung compliance. Further, fat accumulation in the soft tissue of the pharynx can increase inspiratory resistance, and obesity may be associated with sleep apnea. Obesity is associated with several defects in cell-mediated immunity, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Impaired adipocyte-mediated immune function results in chronically high leptin levels, low adiponectin levels, and anti-inflammatory adipokines. Reduced physical activity can impair several steps of the immune response to viruses. Obesity also promotes a hypercoagulable state, leading to severe consequences. These factors may synergistically play a role in promoting the severity of the disease in obese individuals. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which obesity contributes to the severity of COVID-19 is important for developing more effective treatments.","Obesity is a risk factor for disease severity in individuals with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study designed to evaluate the association between body mass index and risk of severe disease in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Data were abstracted from the electronic health record. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death. SETTING: Two hospitals in Massachusetts (one quaternary referral center and one affiliated community hospital). PATIENTS: Consecutive patients hospitalized with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 admitted between March 13, 2020, and April 3, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 305 patients were included in this study. We stratified patients by body mass index category: < 25 kg/m (54 patients, 18%), >/= 25 kg/m to < 30 kg/m (124 patients, 41%), >/= 30 kg/m to < 35 kg/m (58 patients, 19%), and >/= 35 kg/m (69 patients, 23%).

506,33044691,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present as a range of symptoms, from mild to critical; lower pulmonary involvement, including pneumonia, is often associated with severe and critical cases. Understanding the baseline characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 illness is essential for effectively targeting clinical care and allocating resources. This study aimed to describe baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement. METHODS: US patients with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement during an inpatient admission from December 1, 2019, to May 20, 2020, were identified using the IBM Explorys((R)) electronic health records database. Baseline (up to 12 months prior to first COVID-19 hospitalization) demographics and clinical characteristics and preadmission (14 days to 1 day prior to admission) pulmonary diagnoses were assessed. Patients were stratified by sex, age, race, and geographic region. RESULTS: Overall, 3471 US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement were included. The mean (SD) age was 63.5 (16.3) years; 51.2% of patients were female, 55.0% African American, 81.6% from the South, and 16.8% from the Midwest. The most common comorbidities included hypertension (27.7%), diabetes (17.3%), hyperlipidemia (16.3%), and obesity (9.7%). Cough (27.3%) and dyspnea (15.2%) were the most common preadmission pulmonary symptoms. African American patients were younger (mean [SD], 62.5 [15.4] vs. 67.8 [6.2]) with higher mean (SD) body mass index (33.66 [9.46] vs. 30.42 [7.86]) and prevalence of diabetes (19.8% vs. 16.7%) and lower prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.6% vs. 8.2%) and smoking/tobacco use (28.1% vs. 37.2%) than White patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among US patients primarily from the South and Midwest hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement, the most common comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Differences observed between African American and White patients should be considered in the context of the complex factors underlying racial disparities in COVID-19.","INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present as a range of symptoms, from mild to critical; lower pulmonary involvement, including pneumonia, is often associated with severe and critical cases.

512,33022004,"BACKGROUND: The global rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission during the COVID-19 pandemic varies within countries and is among the main challenges for health care systems worldwide. Conflicting results have been reported about the response to coronavirus infection and COVID-19 outcomes in men and women. Understanding predictors of intensive care unit admission might be of help for future planning and management of the disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We designed a cross-sectional observational multicenter nationwide survey in Italy to understand gender-related clinical predictors of ICU admission in patients with COVID-19. We analyzed information from 2378 charts of Italian patients certified for COVID-19 admitted in 26 hospitals. Three hundred ninety-five patients (16.6%) required ICU admission due to COVID19 infection, more frequently men (74%), with a higher prevalence of comorbidities (1,78+/-0,06 vs 1,54+/-0,03 p<0.05). In multivariable regression model main predictors of admission to ICU are male gender (OR 1,74 95% CI 1,36-2,22 p<0.0001) and presence of obesity (OR 2,88 95% CI 2,03-4,07 p<0.0001), chronic kidney disease (OR: 1,588; 95%, 1,036-2,434 p<0,05) and hypertension (OR: 1,314; 95% 1,039-1,662; p<0,05). In gender specific analysis, obesity, chronic kidney disease and hypertension are associated with higher rate of admission to ICU among men, whereas in women, obesity (OR: 2,564; 95% CI 1,336-4.920 p<0.0001) and heart failure (OR: 1,775 95% CI: 1,030-3,057) are associated with higher rate of ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that gender is the primary determinant of the disease's severity among COVID-19. Obesity is the condition more often observed among those admitted to ICU within both genders.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 10, 2020 and July 31, 2020 at seven hospitals in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Outcomes included clinical improvement within 30 days (primary) and in-hospital mortality (secondary). Of 766 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 500 (65.6%) were male, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 46 (34-58) years. One hundred ninety-one (25%) patients had severe/critical disease requiring admission in the intensive care unit (ICU). Six hundred twenty patients (80.9%) improved and were discharged within 30 days of admission. Overall in-hospital mortality was 13.2% (95% CI: 10.9-15.8), and almost 50% among those in the ICU. Independent risk factors for death were age < 20 years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 6.62, 95% CI: 1.85-23.64), 40-59 years (aHR = 4.45, 95% CI: 1.83-10.79), and >/= 60 years (aHR = 13.63, 95% CI: 5.70-32.60) compared with those aged 20-39 years, with obesity (aHR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.24-4.27), and with chronic kidney disease (aHR = 5.33, 95% CI: 1.85-15.35).

514,33007661,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Corona virus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread rapidly. Growing evidences that overweight and obesity which extent nearly a third of the world population were associated with severe COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the association and risk of increased BMI and obesity with composite poor outcome in COVID-19 adult patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase database. We included all original research articles in COVID-19 adult patients and obesity based on classification of Body Mass Index (BMI) and composite poor outcome which consist of ICU admission, ARDS, severe COVID-19, use of mechanical ventilation, hospital admission, and mortality. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included in meta-analysis with 9 studies presented BMI as continuous outcome and 10 studies presented BMI as dichotomous outcome (cut-off >/=30 kg/m(2)). COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome had higher BMI with mean difference 1.12 (95% CI, 0.67-1.57, P < 0.001). Meanwhile, obesity was associated with composite poor outcome with odds ratio (OR) = 1.78 (95% CI, 1.25-2.54, P < 0.001) Multivariate meta-regression showed the association between BMI and obesity on composite poor outcome were affected by age, gender, DM type 2, and hypertension. CONCLUSION: Obesity is a risk factor of composite poor outcome of COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 patients with composite poor outcome have higher BMI. BMI is an important routine procedure that should always be assessed in the management of COVID-19 patients and special attention should be given to patients with obesity.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Corona virus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread rapidly.

515,33002780,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The link between diabetes and increased risk of infectious disease has long been recognized, but has re-entered sharp focus following the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed for articles in English on diabetes and infection. RESULTS: Diabetes predisposes to infections through alterations in innate and acquired immune defenses. Outcomes of infection are worse in people with uncontrolled diabetes, and infection can worsen hyperglycemia in hitherto well controlled diabetes (bidirectional relationship). Diabetes does not increase the risk of infection with COVID-19 per se, but predisposes to severe disease and poor outcomes. COVID-19 has also been linked to deterioration of glycemic control as well as new-onset diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians caring for people with diabetes should be aware of the increased risk of infections in this population, as well as the possibility of worsening hyperglycemia. A holistic approach with frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels and appropriate titration of medications, along with close attention to nutritional status, is essential to ensure the best possible outcomes.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The link between diabetes and increased risk of infectious disease has long been recognized, but has re-entered sharp focus following the COVID-19 pandemic.

516,33002478,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The effects of obesity on clinical outcomes of COVID-19 warrant systematical investigation. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the effects of obesity with the risk of severe disease among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Body mass index (BMI) and degree of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) accumulation were used as indicators for obesity status. Publication databases including preprints were searched up to August 10, 2020. Clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 included hospitalization, a requirement for treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. Risks for severe COVID-19 outcomes are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for cohort studies with BMI-defined obesity, and standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95%CI for controlled studies with VAT-defined excessive adiposity. RESULTS: A total of 45, 650 participants from 30 studies with BMI-defined obesity and 3 controlled studies with VAT-defined adiposity were included for assessing the risk of severe COVID-19. Univariate analyses showed significantly higher ORs of severe COVID-19 with higher BMI: 1.76 (95%: 1.21, 2.56, P=0.003) for hospitalization, 1.67 (95%CI: 1.26, 2.21, P<0.001) for ICU admission, 2.19 (95%CI: 1.56, 3.07, P<0.001) for IMV requirement, and 1.37 (95%CI: 1.06, 1.75, P=0.014) for death, giving an overall OR for severe COVID-19 of 1.67 (95%CI: 1.43, 1.96; P<0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed increased ORs of severe COVID-19 associated with higher BMI: 2.36 (95%CI: 1.37, 4.07, P=0.002) for hospitalization, 2.32 (95%CI: 1.38, 3.90, P=0.001) for requiring ICU admission, 2.63 (95%CI: 1.32, 5.25, P=0.006) for IMV support, and 1.49 (95%CI: 1.20, 1.85, P<0.001) for mortality, giving an overall OR for severe COVID-19 of 2.09 (95%CI: 1.67, 2.62; P<0.001). Compared to non-severe COVID-19 patients, severe COVID-19 cases showed significantly higher VAT accumulation with a SMD of 0.49 for hospitalization (95% CI: 0.11, 0.87; P=0.011), 0.57 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.81; P<0.001) for requiring ICU admission and 0.37 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.71; P=0.035) for IMV support. The overall SMD for severe COVID-19 was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.68; P<0.001).

517,32995660,"COVID-19 has shown a substantial variation in the rate and severity by which it impacts different demographic groups. Specifically, it has shown a predilection towards obese patients as well as well as other vulnerable groups including predilection of males over females, old age over young age and black races over Caucasian ones. Single cell sequencing studies have highlighted the role of cell polarity and the co-expression of proteases, such as Furin, along with ACE2 in the genesis of coronavirus disease rather than exclusively link tissue involvement with ACE2 levels thought previously. It has also forged a connection between the genetic and immune cellular mechanisms underlying COVID infection and the inflammatory state of obese patients, offering a more accurate explanation as to why obese patients are at increased risk of poor COVID outcomes. These commonalities encompass macrophage phenotype switching, genetic expression switching, and overexpression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, depletion of the regulatory cytokines, in situ T cell proliferation, and T cell exhaustion. These findings demonstrate the necessity of single cell sequencing as a rapid means to identify and treat those who are most likely to need hospital admission and intensive care, in the hopes of precision medicine. Furthermore, this study underlines the use of immune modulators such as Leptin sensitizers, rather than immune suppressors as anti-inflammation therapies to switch the inflammatory response from a drastic immunological type 1 response to a beneficial type 2 effective one.","COVID-19 has shown a substantial variation in the rate and severity by which it impacts different demographic groups.

519,32986989,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 may be associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancy, but there are few controlled data to quantify the magnitude of these risks or to characterize the epidemiology and risk factors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify the associations of coronavirus disease 2019 with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancy and to characterize the epidemiology and risk factors. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a matched case-control study of pregnant patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 cases who delivered between 16 and 41 weeks' gestation from March 11 to June 11, 2020. Uninfected pregnant women (controls) were matched to coronavirus disease 2019 cases on a 2:1 ratio based on delivery date. Maternal demographic characteristics, coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms, laboratory evaluations, obstetrical and neonatal outcomes, and clinical management were chart abstracted. The primary outcomes included (1) a composite of adverse maternal outcome, defined as preeclampsia, venous thromboembolism, antepartum admission, maternal intensive care unit admission, need for mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen, or maternal death, and (2) a composite of adverse neonatal outcome, defined as respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, 5-minute Apgar score of <5, persistent category 2 fetal heart rate tracing despite intrauterine resuscitation, or neonatal death. To quantify the associations between exposure to mild and severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed using conditional logistic regression (to account for matching), with matched-pair odds ratio and 95% confidence interval based on 1000 bias-corrected bootstrap resampling as the effect measure. Associations were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 61 confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 cases were enrolled during the study period (mild disease, n=54 [88.5%]; severe disease, n=6 [9.8%]; critical disease, n=1 [1.6%]). The odds of adverse composite maternal outcome were 3.4 times higher among cases than controls (18.0% vs 8.2%; adjusted odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-13.4). The odds of adverse composite neonatal outcome were 1.7 times higher in the case group than to the control group (18.0% vs 13.9%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-4.8).

524,32980956,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Obesity has been associated with increased disease severity in COVID-19, and obesity is strongly associated with hepatic steatosis (HS). However, how HS alters the natural history of COVID-19 is not well characterized, especially in Western populations. AIMS: To characterize the impact of HS on disease severity and liver injury in COVID-19. METHODS: We examined the association between HS and disease severity in a single-center cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at Michigan Medicine. HS was defined by either hepatic steatosis index > 36 (for Asians) or > 39 (for non-Asians) or liver imaging demonstrating steatosis > 30 days before onset of COVID-19. The primary predictor was HS. The primary outcomes were severity of cardiopulmonary disease, transaminitis, jaundice, and portal hypertensive complications. RESULTS: In a cohort of 342 patients, metabolic disease was highly prevalent including nearly 90% overweight. HS was associated with increased transaminitis and need for intubation, dialysis, and vasopressors. There was no association between HS and jaundice or portal hypertensive complications. In a sensitivity analysis including only patients with liver imaging > 30 days before onset of COVID-19, imaging evidence of hepatic steatosis remained associated with disease severity and risk of transaminitis.

526,32979575,"OBJECTIVES: The case fatality rate (CFR) of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) varies significantly between countries. We aimed to describe the associations between health indicators and the national CFRs of COVID-19. METHODS: We identified for each country health indicators potentially associated with the national CFRs of COVID-19. We extracted data for 18 variables from international administrative data sources for 34 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We excluded the collinear variables and examined the 16 variables in multivariable analysis. A dynamic web-based model was developed to analyse and display the associations for the CFRs of COVID-19. We followed the Guideline for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, the variables significantly associated with the increased CFRs were percentage of obesity in ages >18 years (beta = 3.26; 95%CI = 1.20, 5.33; p 0.003), tuberculosis incidence (beta = 3.15; 95%CI = 1.09, 5.22; p 0.004), duration (days) since first death due to COVID-19 (beta = 2.89; 95%CI = 0.83, 4.96; p 0.008), and median age (beta = 2.83; 95%CI = 0.76, 4.89; p 0.009).

528,32975565,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease that has reached pandemic status by rapidly spreading worldwide. Elderly individuals and patients with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension show a higher risk of hospitalization, severe disease, and mortality by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. These patients frequently show exacerbated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines associated with an overreaction of the immune system, the so-called cytokine storm.

Objective: To identify excess risk and risk factors associated with hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study included 88747 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction between Feburary 28 and May 14, 2020, and followed up through June 22, 2020, in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) national health care system, including 10131 patients (11.4%) who tested positive. Exposures: Sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, symptoms, and laboratory test results. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death were estimated in time-to-event analyses using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: The 10131 veterans with SARS-CoV-2 were predominantly male (9221 [91.0%]), with diverse race/ethnicity (5022 [49.6%] White, 4215 [41.6%] Black, and 944 [9.3%] Hispanic) and a mean (SD) age of 63.6 (16.2) years. Compared with patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, those who tested positive had higher rates of 30-day hospitalization (30.4% vs 29.3%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.08-1.13), mechanical ventilation (6.7% vs 1.7%; aHR, 4.15; 95% CI, 3.74-4.61), and death (10.8% vs 2.4%; aHR, 4.44; 95% CI, 4.07-4.83). Among patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, characteristics significantly associated with mortality included older age (eg, >/=80 years vs <50 years: aHR, 60.80; 95% CI, 29.67-124.61), high regional COVID-19 disease burden (eg, >/=700 vs <130 deaths per 1 million residents: aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.45), higher Charlson comorbidity index score (eg, >/=5 vs 0: aHR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.54-2.42), fever (aHR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.32-1.72), dyspnea (aHR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.53-2.07), and abnormalities in the certain blood tests, which exhibited dose-response associations with mortality, including aspartate aminotransferase (>89 U/L vs </=25 U/L: aHR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.35-2.57), creatinine (>3.80 mg/dL vs 0.98 mg/dL: aHR, 3.79; 95% CI, 2.62-5.48), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (>12.70 vs </=2.71: aHR, 2.88; 95% CI, 2.12-3.91).

531,32965474,"BACKGROUND: Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in blood, also known as RNAemia, has been reported, but its prognostic implications are poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and its association with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical severity. METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single-center tertiary care institution and included consecutive inpatients and outpatients with confirmed COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables were examined and included intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and 30-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Paired nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were included from 85 patients. The median age was 55 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma (63 vs 50 years; P = .04). Comorbidities were frequent including obesity (37.6%), hypertension (30.6%), and diabetes mellitus (22.4%). RNAemia was detected in 28/85 (32.9%) of patients, including 22/28 (78.6%) who required hospitalization. In models adjusted for age, RNAemia was detected more frequently in individuals who developed severe disease including ICU admission (32.1 vs 14.0%; P = .04) and invasive mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 3.5%; P = .02). All 4 deaths occurred in individuals with detectable RNAemia. An additional 121 plasma samples from 28 individuals with RNAemia were assessed longitudinally, and RNA was detected for a maximum duration of 10 days.

533,32961440,"This review focuses on the hypothetical mechanisms for enhanced vulnerability of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 severity, and increased deaths. A disproportionately higher number of African Americans are afflicted with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, obesity), and SARS-CoV-2 has helped expose these health disparities. Several factors including socioeconomic status, inferior health care, and work circumstances contribute to these disparities. Identifying potential inflammatory biomarkers and decreasing basal levels in high-risk individuals with comorbidities through preventive measures is critical. Immune cells, particularly neutrophils, protect us against pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) through increased generation of free radicals or oxidants and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that ensnare pathogens, killing them extracellularly. However, continued generation of NETs coupled with the lack of prompt removal pose danger to host cells. NET levels are increased during pro-inflammatory diseases. COVID-19 patients exhibit elevated NET levels, depending upon disease severity. Conceivably, high-risk individuals with elevated basal NET levels would exhibit hyper-inflammation when infected with SARS-CoV-2, amplifying disease severity and deaths. Drugs inhibiting oxidant formation and vitamin supplements decreased NET formation in mice models of inflammation. Thus, it is conceivable that preventive treatments lowering NET levels and inflammation in high-risk individuals could mitigate SARS-CoV-2-induced complications and decrease mortality.","This review focuses on the hypothetical mechanisms for enhanced vulnerability of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 severity, and increased deaths.

534,32960645,"BACKGROUND: Risk factors for progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to severe disease or death are underexplored in U.S. cohorts. OBJECTIVE: To determine the factors on hospital admission that are predictive of severe disease or death from COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: Five hospitals in the Maryland and Washington, DC, area. PATIENTS: 832 consecutive COVID-19 admissions from 4 March to 24 April 2020, with follow-up through 27 June 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Patient trajectories and outcomes, categorized by using the World Health Organization COVID-19 disease severity scale. Primary outcomes were death and a composite of severe disease or death. RESULTS: Median patient age was 64 years (range, 1 to 108 years); 47% were women, 40% were Black, 16% were Latinx, and 21% were nursing home residents. Among all patients, 131 (16%) died and 694 (83%) were discharged (523 [63%] had mild to moderate disease and 171 [20%] had severe disease). Of deaths, 66 (50%) were nursing home residents. Of 787 patients admitted with mild to moderate disease, 302 (38%) progressed to severe disease or death: 181 (60%) by day 2 and 238 (79%) by day 4. Patients had markedly different probabilities of disease progression on the basis of age, nursing home residence, comorbid conditions, obesity, respiratory symptoms, respiratory rate, fever, absolute lymphocyte count, hypoalbuminemia, troponin level, and C-reactive protein level and the interactions among these factors. Using only factors present on admission, a model to predict in-hospital disease progression had an area under the curve of 0.85, 0.79, and 0.79 at days 2, 4, and 7, respectively.

537,32953947,"ABSTRACT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has emerged as a global pandemic. This viral disease primarily causes lung pneumonia and has a wide range of clinical manifestations. The severity of infection ranges from those who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms which do not require hospital admission, to those who require ventilator support and eventually die, depending on immunity, age and other comorbidities existing with the patients. The present report is an attempt to study the effect of physiological and environmental factors existing at high altitudes (HA) with spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of existing data revealed that HA natives do possess certain physiological advantages such as (1) improved hypoxic ventilatory response, (2) higher concentration of oxygen carrying molecules, haemoglobin, (3) increased production of Vitamin D, due to intense solar radiation, (4) lower rates of comorbidities such as lung infections, obesity etc. and (5) most importantly reduced production of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a carrier molecule for SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into the host cell; all of which can collectively account for improved tolerance to SARS-CoV-2 infection in HA natives. In addition, environmental factors at HA such as (6) dry and chilly winds, (7) low air density and (8) intense UV radiations may further inhibit viral growth and spread into the atmosphere. We thus conclude that, high altitude natives may posses physiological and environmental advantage over low landers in terms of reduced severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its limited spread.

538,32953842,"Gender-specific differences in the prevalence, incidence, comorbidities, prognosis, severity, risk factors, drug-related aspects and outcomes of various medical conditions are well documented. We present a literature review on the extent to which research in this field has developed over the years, and reveal gaps in gender-sensitive awareness between the clinical portrayal and the translation into gender-specific treatment regimens, guidelines and into gender-oriented preventive strategies and health policies. Subsequently, through the lens of gender, we describe these domains in detail for four selected medical conditions: Asthma, obesity and overweight, chronic kidney disease and coronavirus disease 2019. As some of the key gender differences become more apparent during adolescence, we focus on this developmental stage. Finally, we propose a model which is based on three influential issues: (1) Investigating gender-specific medical profiles of related health conditions, rather than a single disease; (2) The dynamics of gender disparities across developmental stages; and (3) An integrative approach which takes into account additional risk factors (ethnicity, socio-demographic variables, minorities, lifestyle habits etc.). Increasing the awareness of gender-specific medicine in daily practice and in tailored guidelines, already among adolescents, may reduce inequities, facilitate the prediction of future trends and properly address the characteristics and needs of certain subpopulations within each gender.","Gender-specific differences in the prevalence, incidence, comorbidities, prognosis, severity, risk factors, drug-related aspects and outcomes of various medical conditions are well documented.

METHODS: Three hundred and seventy nine adult patients who presented to COVID-19 screening outpatient department of the hospital were interviewed over the phone regarding their body weight and height. The COVID-19 RT-PCR report of the patients was extracted from the hospital information system. RESULTS: The mean BMI and the prevalence of obesity was observed to be higher in individuals who were detected to be COVID-19 RT-PCR positive as compared to those who were negative. With every one-unit increment in BMI above 23 kg/m(2), the odds of being COVID-19 positive increased by 1.8 times among these patients.

540,32949592,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents an unprecedented health crisis to the entire world. As reported, the body mass index (BMI) may play an important role in COVID-19; however, this still remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the association between BMI and COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHODS: The Medline, PubMed, Embase and Web of science were systematically searched until August 2020. Random-effects models and dose-response meta-analysis were used to synthesize the results. Combined odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and the effect of covariates were analyzed using subgroup analysis and meta-regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 16 observational studies involving 109,881 patients with COVID-19 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that patients with a BMI>/=30kg/m(2) had a 2.35-fold risk (OR=2.35, 95%CI=1.64-3.38, P<0.001) for critical COVID-19 and a 2.68-fold risk for COVID-19 mortality (OR=2.68, 95%CI=1.65-4.37, P<0.001) compared with patients with a BMI <30kg/m(2). Subgroup analysis results showed that patients with obesity and age>60years was associated with a significantly increased risk of critical COVID-19 (OR=3.11, 95%CI=1.73-5.61, P<0.001) and COVID-19 mortality (OR=3.93, 95%CI=2.18-7.09, P<0.001). Meta-regression analysis results also showed that age had a significant influence on the association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality (Coef.=0.036, P=0.048). Random-effects dose-response meta-analysis showed a linear association between BMI and both critical COVID-19(Pnon-linearity=0.242) and mortality (Pnon-linearity=0.116). The risk of critical COVID-19 and mortality increased by 9%(OR=1.09, 95%CI=1.04-1.14, P<0.001) and 6%(OR=1.06, 95%CI=1.02-1.10, P=0.002) for each 1kg/m(2) increase in BMI, respectively.

543,32941186,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Old age, obesity and vitamin D deficiency are considered as independent risk factors for severe courses of COVID-19. The aim of the review is to discuss common features of these risk factors and the impact of vitamin D. RECENT FINDINGS: The recently discovered relationship between vitamin D and the infection pathway of the virus via the renin--angiotensin system (RAS) and the adipokines leptin and adiponectin play an important role. The frequency of studies showing a relationship between a low vitamin D status in comorbidities and severe COVID-19 courses makes an impact of vitamin D effects likely. SUMMARY: There is a direct relationship between vitamin D, body fat and age in COVID-19 courses. With age, the ability of the skin to synthesize vitamin D decreases, and leads to vitamin D-deficits. If the skin is insufficiently exposed to sunlight, severe deficits can develop. As vitamin D plays an important role not only in the immune system but also in the RAS, and thus at the point where the virus attacks, a good vitamin D supply is an important basis for reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 processes. Treatment with vitamin D supplements should be based on severity of the vitamin D deficiency.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Old age, obesity and vitamin D deficiency are considered as independent risk factors for severe courses of COVID-19.

544,32938838,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health concern that can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical, based on disease severity. Since the identification of critical patients is crucial for developing effective management strategies, we evaluated clinical characteristics, laboratory data, treatment provided, and oxygenation to identify potential predictors of mortality among critical COVID-19 pneumonia patients. We retrospectively utilized data from seven critical patients who were admitted to our hospital during April 2020 and required mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint was to clarify potential predictor of mortality. All patients were older than 70 years, five were men, six had hypertension, and three ultimately died. Compared with survivors, non-survivors tended to be never smokers (0 pack-years vs. 30 pack-years, p = 0.08), to have higher body mass index (31.3 kg/m(2) vs. 25.3 kg/m(2), p = 0.06), to require earlier tracheal intubation after symptom onset (2.7 days vs. 5.5 days, p = 0.07), and had fewer lymphocytes on admission (339 /muL vs. 518 /muL, p = 0.05). During the first week after tracheal intubation, non-survivors displayed lower values for minimum ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspiratory oxygen concentration (P/F ratio) (44 mmHg vs. 122 mmHg, p < 0.01) and poor response to intensive therapy compared with survivors. In summary, we show that obesity and lymphopenia could predict the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and that the trend of lower P/F ratio during the first week of mechanical ventilation could provide useful prognostic information.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health concern that can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical, based on disease severity.

548,32910251,"OBJECTIVE: To report the peculiarity of spinal epidural abscess in COVID-19 patients, as we have observed an unusually high number of these patients following the outbreak of SARS-Corona Virus-2. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical documentation of six consecutive COVID-19 patients with primary spinal epidural abscess that we surgically managed over a 2-month period. These cases were analyzed for what concerns both the viral infection and the spinal abscess. RESULTS: The abscesses were primary in all cases indicating that no evident infective source was found. A primary abscess represents the rarest form of spinal epidural abscess, which is usually secondary to invasive procedures or spread from adjacent infective sites, such as spondylodiscitis, generally occurring in patients with diabetes, obesity, cancer, or other chronic diseases. In all cases, there was mild lymphopenia but the spinal abscess occurred regardless of the severity of the viral disease, immunologic state, or presence of bacteremia. Obesity was the only risk factor and was reported in two patients. All patients but one were hypertensive. The preferred localizations were cervical and thoracic, whereas classic abscess generally occur at the lumbar level. No patient had a history of pyogenic infection, even though previous asymptomatic bacterial contaminations were reported in three cases. CONCLUSION: We wonder about the concentration of this uncommon disease in such a short period. To our knowledge, cases of spinal epidural abscess in COVID-19 patients have not been reported to date. We hypothesize that, in our patients, the spinal infection could have depended on the coexistence of an initially asymptomatic bacterial contamination. The well-known COVID-19-related endotheliitis might have created the conditions for retrograde bacterial invasion to the correspondent spinal epidural space. Furthermore, spinal epidural abscess carries a significantly high morbidity and mortality. It is difficult to diagnose, especially in compromised COVID-19 patients but should be kept in mind as early diagnosis and treatment are crucial.","OBJECTIVE: To report the peculiarity of spinal epidural abscess in COVID-19 patients, as we have observed an unusually high number of these patients following the outbreak of SARS-Corona Virus-2.

METHODS: Our data stem from an adult cohort created to prospectively investigate the relationship between diet and morbidity and mortality from chronic non-communicable diseases in Brazil. For this study, we selected the first participants (n = 10,116) who answered twice to a simplified questionnaire on their diet the day before, the first time when entering the study, between January 26 and February 15, 2020, and the second between May 10 and 19, 2020.

Comparisons of indicators based on the consumption of these markers before and during the pandemic are presented for the study population and according to gender, age group, macro-region of residence and schooling. Chi-square tests and t-tests were used to compare proportions and means, respectively, adopting p < 0.05 to identify significant differences. RESULTS: For all participants, we found a modest but statistically significant increase in the consumption of healthy eating markers and stability in the consumption of unhealthy food markers. This favorable pattern of dietary changes during the pandemic occurred in most sociodemographic strata. We observed a less favorable changing pattern, with a tendency to increasing consumption of healthy and unhealthy food markers, in the Northeast and North macro-regions and among people with less schooling, suggesting social inequalities in the response to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: If confirmed, the trend of increased consumption of ultra-processed foods in underdeveloped regions and by people with less schooling is concerning, as eating these foods increases the risk of obesity, hypertension and diabetes, whose presence increases the severity and lethality of covid-19.","OBJECTIVE: To describe the dietary characteristics of participants in the NutriNet Brasil cohort immediately before and during the covid-19 pandemic.

550,32896798,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with severe COVID-19 can develop ventilator-dependent acute hypoxic respiratory failure (VDAHRF), which is associated with a higher mortality rate. We evaluated the clinical course of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and compared them with the patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation. Characteristics of intubated patients who were successfully weaned from the ventilator were compared with the patients who failed to be extubated or died in the hospital. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical course of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and assess the possible predictors of the disease severity leading to VDAHRF. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study. The first 129 patients (18 years or older) with COVID-19 admitted to Monmouth Medical Center from March 1st to April 25th, 2020 were included. RESULTS: Out of 129 patients, 23.25% (n = 30) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and of those, six patients were successfully weaned from the ventilator.

We evaluated the clinical course of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and compared them with the patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation. Characteristics of intubated patients who were successfully weaned from the ventilator were compared with the patients who failed to be extubated or died in the hospital. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical course of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and assess the possible predictors of the disease severity leading to VDAHRF. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study. The first 129 patients (18 years or older) with COVID-19 admitted to Monmouth Medical Center from March 1st to April 25th, 2020 were included.

551,32891697,"Obese patients who often present metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) are at risk of severe presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These patients are more likely to be hospitalized and receive antiviral agents and other drugs required to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic inflammation, combat bacterial and fungal superinfections and reverse multi-organ failure. Among these pharmaceuticals, antiretrovirals such as lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir, antibiotics and antifungal agents can induce drug-induced liver injury (DILI), whose mechanisms are not always understood. In the present article, we hypothesize that obese COVID-19 patients with MAFLD might be at higher risk for DILI than non-infected healthy individuals or MAFLD patients. These patients present several concomitant factors, which individually can favour DILI: polypharmacy, systemic inflammation at risk of cytokine storm, fatty liver and sometimes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as well as insulin resistance and other diseases linked to obesity. Hence, in obese COVID-19 patients, some drugs might cause more severe (and/or more frequent) DILI, while others might trigger the transition of fatty liver to NASH, or worsen pre-existing steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis. We also present the main mechanisms whereby drugs can be more hepatotoxic in MAFLD including impaired activity of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered lipid homeostasis and oxidative stress. Although comprehensive investigations are needed to confirm our hypothesis, we believe that the current epidemic of obesity and related metabolic diseases has extensively contributed to increase the number of cases of DILI in COVID-19 patients, which may have participated in presentation severity and death.","Obese patients who often present metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) are at risk of severe presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

552,32885905,"OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the association between severe obesity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization and severe disease. METHODS: The incidence of hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was evaluated in a prospective population-based cohort of 433,995 persons aged 25 to 79 years in Spain during March and April of 2020. Persons with and without class 3 obesity were compared using Poisson regression to estimate the adjusted relative risk (aRR) from class 3 obesity of COVID-19 hospitalization and of severe disease (intensive care unit admission or death). Differences in the effect by age, sex, and chronic conditions were evaluated. RESULTS: Individuals with class 3 obesity had a higher risk of hospitalization (aRR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.66-2.93) and developing severe COVID-19 (aRR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.20-4.40). In people younger than 50 years, these effects were more pronounced (aRR = 5.02, 95% CI: 3.19-7.90 and aRR = 13.80, 95% CI: 3.11-61.17, respectively), whereas no significant effects were observed in those aged 65 to 79 years (aRR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.70-2.12 and aRR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.52-3.88, respectively). Sex and chronic conditions did not modify the effect of class 3 obesity in any of the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Severe obesity is a relevant risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization and severity in young adults, having a magnitude similar to that of aging. Tackling the current obesity pandemic could alleviate the impact of chronic and infectious diseases.","OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the association between severe obesity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization and severe disease.

554,32881654,"BACKGROUND: The identification of vulnerable subgroups and risk factors associated with the susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is of utmost importance in a pandemic scenario. Potential interactions between renin-angiotensin system (RAS), immune markers and COVID-19 play a role in disease outcome in specific groups of patients. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to describe the particularities of the RAS and the immune system profile of particular subgroups of patients. METHODS: This non-systematic review summarizes evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection in specific subgroups of patients and possible relationships between immune system, RAS and the pathophysiology of COVID-19. RESULTS: The RAS and the immune system exert a role in the pathogenesis and prognosis of COVID-19, mainly in cases of hypertension, diabetes, obesity and other chronic diseases. The overactivation of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis and the enhancement of inflammation contribute to deleterious effects of COVID-19. Likewise, pregnant women and elderly patients usually display immune responses that are less effective in withstanding exposition to viruses, while children are relatively protected against severe complications of COVID-19. Women, conversely, exhibit stronger antiviral responses and are less sensitive to the effects of increased Ang II. Future Perspectives: The recognition of vulnerable subgroups and risk factors for disease severity is essential to better understand the pandemic. Precision medicine tools, including proteomics and metabolomics approaches, identified metabolic patterns of the severe form of disease and might be the alternative to diagnose, evaluate and predict the prognosis and the efficiency of therapies.","BACKGROUND: The identification of vulnerable subgroups and risk factors associated with the susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is of utmost importance in a pandemic scenario.

The prevalence of likely COVID-19 and its risk factors in patients followed up after BS was assessed. METHODS: A total of 738 patients who underwent BS and were followed up at a university medical center were surveyed. A retrospective comparison of characteristics at baseline, 1 year after BS, and at the time of lockdown was performed between patients with COVID-19-likely events (CL) based on a combination of reported symptoms and those for whom COVID-19 was unlikely. RESULTS: CL occurred in 62 (8.4%) patients, among whom 4 (6.4%) had a severe form requiring hospitalization and 1 (1.6%) died. The CL group had a higher proportion of persistent type 2 diabetes (T2D) at last follow-up (36.2% vs. 20.3%, P = 0.01).

Obesity and other components of the metabolic syndrome may aggravate the severity of COVID-19. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between MAFLD and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, case-control study, enrolling 71 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of fatty liver by computed tomography scan. All medical records of eligible patients were reviewed including demographic, clinical, laboratory parameters and data regarding the presence of NAFLD and COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: NAFLD was identified in 22/71 (31%) of the study group. Out of 71, thirteen suffered from severe COVID-19. NAFLD patients had more severe COVID-19 compared with non-NAFLD subjects, 8/22 (36.3%) vs. 5/49(10.2%), (P < 0.005), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that NAFLD subjects were more likely to have severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio 3.57, 95% confidence interval: 1.22, 14.48, P = 0.0031). CONCLUSION: NAFLD represents a high risk for severe COVID-19 irrespective to gender, and independent of metabolic syndrome specifically in male gender. Moreover, obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome were also significantly associated with severe COVID-19.","AIM: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recently encountered disease that was declared a pandemic by WHO in 2020.

Since there is neither a vaccine nor a drug for Covid-19, people with an increased risk for severe and fatal courses of disease particularly need protection. Furthermore, factors increasing these risks are of interest in the search of potential treatments. A systematic literature review on the risk factors of severe and fatal Covid-19 courses is presented. METHODS: The review is carried out on PubMed and a publicly available preprint dataset. For analysis, risk factors are categorized and information regarding the study such as study size and location are extracted. The results are compared to risk factors listed by four public authorities from different countries. RESULTS: The 28 records included, eleven of which are preprints, indicate that conditions and comorbidities connected to a poor state of health such as high age, obesity, diabetes and hypertension are risk factors for severe and fatal disease courses. Furthermore, severe and fatal courses are associated with organ damages mainly affecting the heart, liver and kidneys. Coagulation dysfunctions could play a critical role in the organ damaging. Time to hospital admission, tuberculosis, inflammation disorders and coagulation dysfunctions are identified as risk factors found in the review but not mentioned by the public authorities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this question, we report here the association between pre-infection Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and COVID-19 severity as assessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients with diabetes tested for COVID-19 in Leumit Health Services (LHSs), Israel, between 1 February and 30 April 2020. Using the LHS-integrated electronic medical records system, we were able to collect a large amount of clinical information including age, sex, socio-economic status, weight, height, body mass index, HbA1c, prior diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, smoking, and chronic lung disease. RESULTS: Of the patients included in the cohort, 183 (8.85%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 46 were admitted to hospital. More hospitalized patients were female, came from higher socio-economic background and had a higher baseline HbA1c. A prior diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident and chronic lung disease conferred an increased risk of hospitalization but not obesity or smoking status. In a multivariate analysis, controlling for multiple prior clinical conditions, the only parameter associated with a significantly increased risk for hospitalization was HbA1c >/= 9%. CONCLUSION: Using pre-infection glycaemic control data, we identify HbA1c as a clear predictor of COVID-19 severity.

Current epidemiological studies suggest that COVID-19 affects older patients with multiple comorbidities, such as hypertension, obesity, and chronic lung diseases. The differences in the incidence and severity of COVID-19 are likely to be multifaceted, depending on various biological, social, and economical factors. Specifically, the socioeconomic differences and psychological impact of COVID-19 affecting males and females are essential in pandemic mitigation and preparedness. Previous clinical studies have shown that females are less susceptible to acquire viral infections and reduced cytokine production. Female patients have a higher macrophage and neutrophil activity as well as antibody production and response. Furthermore, in-vivo studies of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) showed higher expression in the kidneys of male than female patients, which may explain the differences in susceptibility and progression of COVID-19 between male and female patients. However, it remains unknown whether the expression of ACE2 differs in the lungs of male or female patients. Disparities in healthcare access and socioeconomic status between ethnic groups may influence COVID-19 rates. Ethnic groups often have higher levels of medical comorbidities and lower socioeconomic status, which may increase their risk of contracting COVID-19 through weak cell-mediated immunity.

568,32846167,"The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic that currently affects the entire world has been shown to be especially dangerous in the elderly (>/=65 years) and in smokers, with notably strong comorbidity in patients already suffering from chronic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, obesity, and hypertension. Inflammation of the lungs is the main factor leading to respiratory distress in patients with chronic respiratory disease and in patients with severe COVID-19. Several studies have shown that inflammation of the lungs in general and Type 2 diabetes are accompanied by the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), especially heparan sulfate (HS). Several studies have also shown the importance of countering the degradation of HS in lung infections and Type 2 diabetes. D-xylose, which is the initiating element for different sulfate GAG chains (especially HS), has shown regeneration properties for GAGs. D-xylose and xylitol have demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antiglycemic, antiviral, and antibacterial properties in lung infections, alone or in combination with antibiotics. Considering the existing research on COVID-19 and related to D-xylose/xylitol, this review offers a perspective on why the association between D-xylose and antibiotics may contribute to significantly reducing the duration of treatment of COVID-19 patients and why some anti-inflammatory drugs may increase the severity of COVID-19. A strong correlation with scurvy, based on gender, age, ethnicity, smoking status, and obesity status, is also reviewed.

572,32838557,"IMPACT STATEMENT: There could be a close relationship between periodontal diseases (PDs) severity and Covid-19 infections. This relationship could be caused by Galectin-3-mediated increased immune response and increased viral attachment. Keeping PDs under control and maintaining rigorous oral hygiene during this troubled Covid-19 pandemic period is very important. Patients with older age and pre-existing conditions like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are in the higher risk group for developing severe Covid-19 infections. The inflammatory pathways that are involved in these conditions are the same pathways that we see in periodontal diseases (PDs). This raises a significant question: Is PD a pre-existing condition that can increase the risk of developing severe Covid-19 infection? Several studies have shown that Galectins play a key role in the homeostasis of immune cells, and recently, a relationship was found between Covid-19 and Galectin-3 (Gal-3).It has been determined that an important area in the spike protein of Coronavirus-19 is almost exactly the same as the morphology of Gal-3, and these spike proteins are critical for the entry of the virus into host cells. We suspect that there is enough evidence to support a close relationship between PDs severity and Covid-19 infections. There is accumulating evidence to suggest a relationship between the severity of PD and the risk of infection with Covid-19, which requires further investigation. This relationship could be caused by Gal-3-mediated increased immune response and increased viral attachment. In this context, we want to emphasize the importance of keeping PD under control by maintaining rigorous oral hygiene during this troubled Covid-19 pandemic period.

574,32835759,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the associations of obesity-related traits (body mass index [BMI], central obesity) and their genetic predisposition with the risk of developing severe COVID-19 in a population-based data. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed data from 489,769 adults enrolled in the UK Biobank-a population-based cohort study. The exposures of interest are BMI categories and central obesity (e.g., larger waist circumference). Using genome-wide genotyping data, we also computed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) that represent an individual's overall genetic risk for each obesity trait. The outcome was severe COVID-19, defined by hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 489,769 individuals, 33% were normal weight (BMI, 18.5-24.9kg/m(2)), 43% overweight (25.0-29.9kg/m(2)), and 24% obese (>/=30.0kg/m(2)). The UK Biobank identified 641 patients with severe COVID-19. Compared to adults with normal weight, those with a higher BMI had a dose-response increases in the risk of severe COVID-19, with the following adjusted ORs: for 25.0-29.9kg/m(2), 1.40 (95%CI 1.14-1.73; P=0.002); for 30.0-34.9kg/m(2), 1.73 (95%CI 1.36-2.20; P<0.001); for 35.0-39.9kg/m(2), 2.82 (95%CI 2.08-3.83; P<0.001); and for >/=40.0kg/m(2), 3.30 (95%CI 2.17-5.03; P<0.001).

578,32827705,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the greatest worldwide pandemic since the 1918 flu. The consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are devastating and represent the current major public health issue across the globe. At the onset, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the respiratory system as it represents the main point of entry in the host, but it also can affect multiple organs. Although most of the patients do not present symptoms or are mildly symptomatic, some people infected with SARS-CoV-2 that experience more severe multiorgan dysfunction. The severity of COVID-19 is typically combined with a set of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and/or advanced age that seriously exacerbates the consequences of the infection. Also, SARS-CoV-2 can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain during the early phases of the disease. Intestinal dysfunction induces changes in intestinal microbes, and an increase in inflammatory cytokines. Thus, diagnosing gastrointestinal symptoms that precede respiratory problems during COVID-19 may be necessary for improved early detection and treatment. Uncovering the composition of the microbiota and its metabolic products in the context of COVID-19 can help determine novel biomarkers of the disease and help identify new therapeutic targets. Elucidating changes to the microbiome as reliable biomarkers in the context of COVID-19 represent an overlooked piece of the disease puzzle and requires further investigation.","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the greatest worldwide pandemic since the 1918 flu.

579,32815621,"OBJECTIVE: Preliminary data from different cohorts of small sample size or with short follow-up indicate poorer prognosis in people with obesity compared with other patients. This study aims to precisely describe the strength of association between obesity in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and mortality and to clarify the risk according to usual cardiometabolic risk factors in a large cohort. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study including 5,795 patients aged 18 to 79 years hospitalized from February 1 to April 30, 2020, in the Paris area, with confirmed infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Adjusted regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for the mortality rate at 30 days across BMI classes, without and with imputation for missing BMI values. RESULTS: Eight hundred ninety-one deaths had occurred at 30 days. Mortality was significantly raised in people with obesity, with the following ORs for BMI of 30 to 35 kg/m(2) , 35 to 40 kg/m(2) , and >40 kg/m(2) : 1.89 (95% CI: 1.45-2.47), 2.79 (95% CI: 1.95-3.97), and 2.55 (95% CI: 1.62-3.95), respectively (18.5-25 kg/m(2) was used as the reference class).

By March, 2020, New York City had become the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States. METHODS: We tracked all patients with confirmed coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection admitted to intensive care units (ICU) at Montefiore Medical Center (Bronx, NY). Data were obtained through manual review of electronic medical records. Patients had at least 30 days of follow-up. RESULTS: Our first 300 ICU patients were admitted March 10 through April 11, 2020. The majority (60.7%) of patients were men. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was documented in 91.7% of patients; 91.3% required mechanical ventilation. Prone positioning was employed in 58% of patients and neuromuscular blockade in 47.8% of mechanically-ventilated patients. Neither intervention was associated with decreased mortality. Vasopressors were required in 77.7% of patients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was present on admission in 40.7% of patients, and developed subsequently in 36.0%; 50.9% of patients with AKI received renal replacement therapy (RRT). Overall 30-day mortality rate was 52.3%, and 55.8% among patients receiving mechanical ventilation. In univariate analysis, higher mortality rate was associated with increasing age, male sex, hypertension, obesity, smoking, number of comorbidities, AKI on presentation, and need for vasopressor support. A representative multivariable model for 30-day mortality is also presented, containing patient age, gender, body mass index, and AKI at admission. As of May 11, 2020, 2 patients (0.7%) remained hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality in critical illness associated with COVID-19 is high. The majority of patients develop ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, vasopressor-dependent shock, and AKI. The variation in mortality rates reported to date likely reflects differences in the severity of illness of the evaluated populations.","BACKGROUND: The first confirmed case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in the United States was reported from the state of Washington in January, 2020.

Here, a comprehensive review of the possible links between GH-insulinlike growth factor 1 axis impairment and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity is offered. First, unequivocal evidence suggests that immune system dysregulation represents a key element in determining SARS-CoV-2 severity, as well as the association with adult-onset GH deficiency (GHD); notably, if GH is physiologically involved in the development and maintenance of the immune system, its pharmacological replacement in GHD patients seems to positively influence their inflammatory status. In addition, the impaired fibrinolysis associated with GHD may represent a further link between GH-insulin-like growth factor 1 axis impairment and COVID-19 severity, as it has been associated with both conditions.

Increasing evidence demonstrates a strong correlation between obesity and the COVID-19 disease. We have summarized recent studies and addressed the impact of obesity on COVID-19 in terms of hospitalization, severity, mortality, and patient outcome. We discuss the potential molecular mechanisms whereby obesity contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition to obesity-related deregulated immune response, chronic inflammation, endothelium imbalance, metabolic dysfunction, and its associated comorbidities, dysfunctional mesenchymal stem cells/adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells may also play crucial roles in fueling systemic inflammation contributing to the cytokine storm and promoting pulmonary fibrosis causing lung functional failure, characteristic of severe COVID-19. Moreover, obesity may also compromise motile cilia on airway epithelial cells and impair functioning of the mucociliary escalators, reducing the clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Obese diseased adipose tissues overexpress the receptors and proteases for the SARS-CoV-2 entry, implicating its possible roles as virus reservoir and accelerator reinforcing violent systemic inflammation and immune response. Finally, anti-inflammatory cytokines like anti-interleukin 6 and administration of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells may serve as potential immune modulatory therapies for supportively combating COVID-19. Obesity is conversely related to the development of COVID-19 through numerous molecular mechanisms and individuals with obesity belong to the COVID-19-susceptible population requiring more protective measures.","The coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide and is becoming a major public health crisis.

Clinical outcomes measured were intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, bleeding and transfusion events, acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality. Pulmonary severity index (PESI) scores were used for risk stratification. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (50%), obesity (27%) and hyperlipidemia (32%) among this cohort. Baseline D-dimer abnormalities (4,647.0 +/- 8,281.8) were noted on admission with a 3-fold increase at the time of PE diagnosis (13,288.4 +/- 14,917.9; p <0.05). Five (5%) patients required systemic thrombolysis and 12 (12%) patients experienced moderate to severe bleeding. Thirty-one (31%) patients developed AKI and 1 (1%) patient required renal replacement therapy. Twenty-three (23%) patients were admitted to intensive care unit, of which 20 (20%) patients received mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate was 20%.

585,32799712,"OBJECTIVE: This is the first comprehensive review to focus on currently available evidence regarding maternal, fetal and neonatal mortality cases associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, up to July 2020. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science databases to identify any reported cases of maternal, fetal or neonatal mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. The references of relevant studies were also hand-searched. RESULTS: Of 2815 studies screened, 10 studies reporting 37 maternal and 12 perinatal mortality cases (7 fetal demise and 5 neonatal death) were finally eligible for inclusion to this review. All maternal deaths were seen in women with previous co-morbidities, of which the most common were obesity, diabetes, asthma and advanced maternal age. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severity of pneumonia were considered as the leading causes of all maternal mortalities, except for one case who died of thromboembolism during postpartum period. Fetal and neonatal mortalities were suggested to be a result of the severity of maternal infection or the prematurity, respectively. Interestingly, there was no evidence of vertical transmission or positive COVID-19 test result among expired neonates. CONCLUSION: Current available evidence suggested that maternal mortality mostly happened among women with previous co-morbidities and neonatal mortality seems to be a result of prematurity rather than infection. However, further reports are needed so that the magnitude of the maternal and perinatal mortality could be determined more precisely.","OBJECTIVE: This is the first comprehensive review to focus on currently available evidence regarding maternal, fetal and neonatal mortality cases associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, up to July 2020.

586,32799381,"OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical characteristics of pregnant and postpartum women with severe COVID-19 in Brazil and to examine risk factors for mortality. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study based on secondary surveillance database analysis. SETTING: Nationwide Brazil. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: 978 Brazilian pregnant and postpartum women notified as COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) cases with complete outcome (death or cure) up to 18 June 2020. METHODS: Data was abstracted from the Brazilian ARDS Surveillance System (ARDS-SS) database. All eligible cases were included. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, intensive care resources use and outcomes were collected. Risk factors for mortality were examined by multivariate logistic regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Case fatality rate. RESULTS: We identified 124 maternal deaths, corresponding to a case fatality rate among COVID-19 ARDS cases in the obstetric population of 12.7%. At least one comorbidity was present in 48.4% of fatal cases compared with 24.9% in survival cases. Among women who died, 58.9% were admitted to ICU, 53.2% had invasive ventilation and 29.0% had no respiratory support. The multivariate logistic regression showed that the main risk factors for maternal death by COVID-19 were being postpartum at onset of ARDS, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, whereas white ethnicity had a protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: Negative outcomes of COVID-19 in this population are affected by clinical characteristics but social determinants of health also seem to play a role. It is urgent to reinforce containment measures targeting the obstetric population and ensure high quality care throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: A total of 124 COVID-19 maternal deaths were identified in Brazil.

587,32796045,"OBJECTIVES: The impact of inflammatory rheumatic diseases on COVID-19 severity is poorly known. Here, we compare the outcomes of a cohort of patients with rheumatic diseases with a matched control cohort to identify potential risk factors for severe illness. METHODS: In this comparative cohort study, we identified hospital PCR+COVID-19 rheumatic patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (IA) or connective tissue diseases (CTDs). Non-rheumatic controls were randomly sampled 1:1 and matched by age, sex and PCR date. The main outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as death, invasive ventilation, intensive care unit admission or serious complications. We assessed the association between the outcome and the potential prognostic variables, adjusted by COVID-19 treatment, using logistic regression. RESULTS: The cohorts were composed of 456 rheumatic and non-rheumatic patients, in equal numbers. Mean age was 63 (IQR 53-78) years and male sex 41% in both cohorts. Rheumatic diseases were IA (60%) and CTD (40%). Most patients (74%) had been hospitalised, and the risk of severe COVID-19 was 31.6% in the rheumatic and 28.1% in the non-rheumatic cohort. Ageing, male sex and previous comorbidity (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular or lung disease) increased the risk in the rheumatic cohort by bivariate analysis. In logistic regression analysis, independent factors associated with severe COVID-19 were increased age (OR 4.83; 95% CI 2.78 to 8.36), male sex (1.93; CI 1.21 to 3.07) and having a CTD (OR 1.82; CI 1.00 to 3.30). CONCLUSION: In hospitalised patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, having a CTD but not IA nor previous immunosuppressive therapies was associated with severe COVID-19.","OBJECTIVES: The impact of inflammatory rheumatic diseases on COVID-19 severity is poorly known.

588,32793244,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third coronavirus leading to a global health outbreak. Despite the high mortality rates from SARS-CoV-1 and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV infections, which both sparked the interest of the scientific community, the underlying physiopathology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, remains partially unclear. SARS-CoV-2 shares similar features with SARS-CoV-1, notably the use of the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells. However, some features of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are unique. In this work, we focus on the association between obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes on the one hand, and the severity of COVID-19 infection on the other, as it seems greater in these patients. We discuss how adipocyte dysfunction leads to a specific immune environment that predisposes obese patients to respiratory failure during COVID-19. We also hypothesize that an ACE2-cleaved protein, angiotensin 1-7, has a beneficial action on immune deregulation and that its low expression during the SARS-CoV-2 infection could explain the severity of infection. This introduces angiotensin 1-7 as a potential candidate of interest in therapeutic research on CoV infections.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third coronavirus leading to a global health outbreak.

589,32790664,"Most reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children aged <18 years appear to be asymptomatic or mild (1). Less is known about severe COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization in children. During March 1-July 25, 2020, 576 pediatric COVID-19 cases were reported to the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), a population-based surveillance system that collects data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in 14 states (2,3). Based on these data, the cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate among children aged <18 years during March 1-July 25, 2020, was 8.0 per 100,000 population, with the highest rate among children aged <2 years (24.8).

Although most patients have mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic, there are patients who can develop serious complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or venous thromboembolism requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care. Hence, it is important to identify patients with a higher risk of complications in a timely manner. Thus, the objective of this paper is to review the hematological laboratory parameters that consistently are altered in COVID-19 and to identify their relationship with the severity of the disease. According to 11 selected reports, the frequency of patients aged > 65 years is higher among subjects severely affected or deceased; likewise, males predominantly suffer from comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes or obesity. Retrospective studies have identified alterations in various hematological and inflammatory parameters as part of the host's response to infection and a secondary increased risk of different thrombotic events. Among these altered parameters, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 have been tested as prognostic biomarkers due to their close relationship with the severity of the disease. Actually, they can reliably indicate the use of antithrombotic therapy at prophylactic or therapeutic doses (mainly D-dimer), as has already been established in those patients who, after an individualized assessment, appear to be at high risk for thrombotic events.","After the first cases of COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, the disease quickly become a pandemic that has seriously affected the economic and health systems in more than 200 countries and territories around the world.

591,32780165,"PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is creating an unprecedented healthcare crisis. Understanding the determinants of mortality is crucial to optimise intensive care unit (ICU) resource use and to identify targets for improving survival. METHODS: In a multicentre retrospective study, we included 379 COVID-19 patients admitted to four ICUs between 20 February and 24 April 2020 and categorised according to time from disease onset to ICU admission. A Cox proportional-hazards model identified factors associated with 28-day mortality. RESULTS: Median age was 66 years (53-68) and 292 (77%) were men. The main comorbidities included obesity and overweight (67%), hypertension (49.6%) and diabetes (30.1%). Median time from disease onset (i.e., viral symptoms) to ICU admission was 8 (6-11) days (missing for three); 161 (42.5%) patients were admitted within a week of disease onset, 173 (45.6%) between 8 and 14 days, and 42 (11.1%) > 14 days after disease onset; day 28 mortality was 26.4% (22-31) and decreased as time from disease onset to ICU admission increased, from 37 to 21% and 12%, respectively. Patients admitted within the first week had higher SOFA scores, more often had thrombocytopenia or acute kidney injury, had more limited radiographic involvement, and had significantly higher blood IL-6 levels. Age, COPD, immunocompromised status, time from disease onset, troponin concentration, and acute kidney injury were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: The excess mortality in patients admitted within a week of disease onset reflected greater non-respiratory severity. Therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 might impact different clinical endpoints according to time since disease onset.","PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is creating an unprecedented healthcare crisis.

Median time from disease onset (i.e., viral symptoms) to ICU admission was 8 (6-11) days (missing for three); 161 (42.5%) patients were admitted within a week of disease onset, 173 (45.6%) between 8 and 14 days, and 42 (11.1%) > 14 days after disease onset; day 28 mortality was 26.4% (22-31) and decreased as time from disease onset to ICU admission increased, from 37 to 21% and 12%, respectively. Patients admitted within the first week had higher SOFA scores, more often had thrombocytopenia or acute kidney injury, had more limited radiographic involvement, and had significantly higher blood IL-6 levels. Age, COPD, immunocompromised status, time from disease onset, troponin concentration, and acute kidney injury were independently associated with mortality.

593,32771867,"In the previous publication ""Can atmospheric pollution be considered a co-factor in extremely high level of SARS-CoV-2 lethality in Northern Italy?"" Conticini et al. hypothesized that the surplus of lethality of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in Northern Italy may be at least in part explained by the evidence of highest pollution reported in this area, as both severe COVID-19 and smog exposure are correlated to an innate immune system hyper-activation with subsequent lung inflammation and injury. Since this hypothesis alone does not fully explain why specific subgroups of patients are at major risk, we hypothesized that obesity may be one of the links between COVID-19 severity and high level of air pollution. First, obesity is a predisposing factor for SARS-Cov-2 infection and worse COVID-19 outcomes, and unequivocal evidence demonstrated that fat mass excess is independently associated with several pulmonary diseases and lung inflammation. Moreover, it has been shown that obesity may intensify the detrimental effects of air pollution on the lungs, and this is not surprising if we consider that these conditions share an excessive activation of the immune system and a lung inflammatory infiltrate. Finally, fat mass excess has also been speculated to be itself a consequence of air pollutants exposure, which has been proved to induce metabolic disruption and weight gain in murine models. In conclusion, although many variables must be taken into account in the analysis of the pandemic, our observations suggest that obesity may act as effect modifier of smog-induced lung-injury, and the concomitant presence of these two factors could better explain the higher virulence, faster spread and greater mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern Italy compared to the rest of the country.","In the previous publication ""Can atmospheric pollution be considered a co-factor in extremely high level of SARS-CoV-2 lethality in Northern Italy?""

594,32768388,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in obese children and adolescents, and its health consequences. SOURCES: Studies published between 2000 and 2020 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, SciELO, and Cochrane databases. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Obesity is a highly prevalent comorbidity in severe cases of COVID-19 in children and adolescents; social isolation may lead to increase fat accumulation. Excessive adipose tissue, deficit in lean mass, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and low intake of essential nutrients are factors that compromise the functioning of organs and systems in obese individuals. These factors are associated with damage to immune, cardiovascular, respiratory, and urinary systems, along with modification of the intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis). In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, these organic changes from obesity may increase the need for ventilatory assistance, risk of thromboembolism, reduced glomerular filtration rate, changes in the innate and adaptive immune response, and perpetuation of the chronic inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: The need for social isolation can have the effect of causing or worsening obesity and its comorbidities, and pediatricians need to be aware of this issue. Facing children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, health professionals should 1) diagnose excess weight; 2) advise on health care in times of isolation; 3) screen for comorbidities, ensuring that treatment is not interrupted; 4) measure levels of immunonutrients; 5) guide the family in understanding the specifics of the situation; and 6) refer to units qualified to care for obese children and adolescents when necessary.","OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 in obese children and adolescents, and its health consequences.

595,32764201,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health crisis. Possible pancreatic involvement has recently been observed in these patients; however, its significance is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of significantly elevated lipase with disease outcomes. METHODS: Data about demographics, symptoms, laboratory values, and clinical outcomes were collected for 1,003 consecutive patients testing positive for COVID-19. Elevated lipase was defined as greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (>3 x ULN). Baseline characteristics among patients with or without elevated lipase were compared using Fisher exact test or Student t-test for categorical or numerical variables, respectively. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of lipase levels with primary clinical outcomes (intensive care unit admission and intubation) adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, history of diabetes, and hypertension. RESULTS: Of 1,003 patients with COVID-19, 83 had available lipase levels and were all admitted to the hospital. Of 83, 14 (16.8%) had elevated lipase (>3 x ULN), which was associated with higher rates of leukocytosis (P < 0.001) and abnormal liver enzymes (P < 0.01). Compared with lower lipase levels (<3 x ULN), patients with elevated lipase had higher rates of ICU admission (92.9% vs 32.8%; P < 0.001) and intubation (78.6% vs 23.5%; P 0.002). In a multivariable-adjusted model, higher lipase levels were significantly associated with admission to the ICU and rate of intubation. DISCUSSION: Lipase elevation is seen in COVID-19 and is associated with worse disease outcomes.","INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health crisis.

Remarkably, the severity of COVID-19 appears to rise with increasing body mass index (BMI). The association between COVID-19 outcomes and overweight/obesity has biological and physiological plausibility. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain this strong association include the chronic pro-inflammatory state, the excessive oxidative stress response, and the impaired immunity that is commonly reported in these individuals. The role of cytokines, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and altered natural killer cell polarization in the dangerous liaison between COVID-19 and obesity are discussed here. These pathways can favor and accelerate the deleterious downstream cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, obesity is well known to be associated with reduced lung function and poor response to mechanical ventilation, thus placing these individuals at high risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19. Furthermore, obesity may lead to other complications, such as renal failure, cardiovascular dysfunction, hypertension, and vascular damage, which in turn can further accelerate negative clinical outcomes from COVID-19. Obese individuals should be shielded against any potential viral exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with consequential considerations for compulsory protection devices and social distancing.

Sub-optimal Se status is common, occurring in a significant proportion of the population across the world including parts of Europe and China. Human and animal studies have shown that Se status is a key determinant of the host response to viral infections. In this review, we address the question whether Se intake is a factor in determining the severity of response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Emphasis is placed on epidemiological and animal studies which suggest that Se affects host response to RNA viruses and on the molecular mechanisms by which Se and selenoproteins modulate the inter-linked redox homeostasis, stress response and inflammatory response. Together these studies indicate that Se status is an important factor in determining the host response to viral infections. Therefore, we conclude that Se status is likely to influence human response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and that Se status is one (of several) risk factors which may impact on the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in populations where Se intake is sub-optimal or low.

Recognition of the associated risks of morbidity and mortality becomes not only imperative but also fundamental to determine the prevention strategies as well as targeting the high-risk populations for appropriate therapies. METHODS: We reviewed, collated and analysed the online database i.e. Pubmed, Google scholar, Researchgate to highlight the demographic and mechanistic link between obesity and associated risks of severity in COVID-19. RESULTS: We observed a changing dynamic in the reporting from the time of initial pandemic in China to currently reported research. While, initially body mass index (BMI) did not find a mention in the data, it is now clearly emerging that obesity is one of the profound risk factors for complications of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our review will help clinicians and health policy makers in considering the importance of obesity in making the prevention and therapeutic strategies of COVID-19. An extra attention and precaution for patients with obesity in COVID-19 pandemic is recommended.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: The pandemic of COVID-19 has put forward the public health system across countries to prepare themselves for the unprecedented outbreak of the present time.

600,32748568,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately impacted the African American community. This study aims to identify the risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease in African American patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of African American patients with COVID-19 treated between March 12 and April 9, 2020, at a single tertiary center. The primary outcome of interest was severe disease defined as those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: The study included 158 consecutive patients. The mean age was 57 years, and 61% were women. The mean (SD) of BMI was 33.2 (8.6) kg/m(2) . Overall, patients admitted to the ICU were older (62 vs. 55 years, P = 0.003) and had higher BMI (36.5 kg/m(2) vs. 31.9 kg/m(2) , P = 0.002). In unadjusted and adjusted analysis, the factors most associated with ICU admission in this sample were age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.073; 95% CI: 1.033-1.114), BMI (aOR: 1.115; 95% CI: 1.052-1.182), and lung disease (aOR: 3.097; 95% CI: 1.137-8.437). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified risk factors for severe disease in COVID-19, specifically in an African American population. Further inclusive research aimed at optimizing clinical care relevant to the African American population is critical to ensure an equitable response to COVID-19.","OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately impacted the African American community.

602,32747830,"Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutic and public health strategies. Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of disease regulators, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including complement and coagulation, as targets of coronaviruses. To determine whether conditions associated with dysregulated complement or coagulation systems impact disease, we performed a retrospective observational study and found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement-activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis and hemorrhage) are risk factors for SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity and mortality-effects that are independent of age, sex or history of smoking. Transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrated that in addition to type-I interferon and interleukin-6-dependent inflammatory responses, infection results in robust engagement of the complement and coagulation pathways. Finally, in a candidate-driven genetic association study of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, we identified putative complement and coagulation-associated loci including missense, eQTL and sQTL variants of critical complement and coagulation regulators. In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to putative transcriptional genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using a multimodal analytical approach to reveal determinants and predictors of immunity, susceptibility and clinical outcome associated with infection.","Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutic and public health strategies.

603,32747155,"BACKGROUND: The population in Mexico has high prevalence rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Hospitalization and death of COVID-19 patients in the countries most affected by the pandemic has been associated to chronic comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of NCDs in patients with COVID-19 in Mexico and analyze the increased risk due to comorbidities and risk factors on hospitalization, utilization of intensive care units and death. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from 212,802 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by the Ministry of Health up to June 27, 2020. Odds ratios were performed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: Up to 47.40% of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were also reported with a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most frequent (20.12%). The report of at least one NCD significantly increased the risk of death with respect to patients without such diagnoses. Chronic kidney disease increased the risk of death the most (OR 2.31), followed by diabetes (OR 1.69), immunosuppression (OR 1.62), obesity (OR 1.42), hypertension (OR 1.24), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.20). The comorbidities that most increased the risk of ICU and of intubation were diabetes, immunosuppression and obesity. CONCLUSION: NCD comorbidities increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. Given high NCD prevalence rates among the Mexican population, the pandemic poses a special threat to the health system and to society. Special prevention measures need to be strengthened for persons with NCD diagnoses in the short-term. In the mid-term, disease control strategies need to be improved to protect these patients against COVID-19 severity.","BACKGROUND: The population in Mexico has high prevalence rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).

608,32726868,"BACKGROUND: Identification of reliable outcome predictors in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is of paramount importance for improving patient's management. METHODS: A systematic review of literature was conducted until 24 April 2020. From 6843 articles, 49 studies were selected for a pooled assessment; cumulative statistics for age and sex were retrieved in 587 790 and 602 234 cases. Two endpoints were defined: (a) a composite outcome including death, severe presentation, hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation; and (b) in-hospital mortality. We extracted numeric data on patients' characteristics and cases with adverse outcomes and employed inverse variance random-effects models to derive pooled estimates. RESULTS: We identified 18 and 12 factors associated with the composite endpoint and death, respectively. Among those, a history of CVD (odds ratio (OR) = 3.15, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 2.26-4.41), acute cardiac (OR = 10.58, 5.00-22.40) or kidney (OR = 5.13, 1.78-14.83) injury, increased procalcitonin (OR = 4.8, 2.034-11.31) or D-dimer (OR = 3.7, 1.74-7.89), and thrombocytopenia (OR = 6.23, 1.031-37.67) conveyed the highest odds for the adverse composite endpoint. Advanced age, male sex, cardiovascular comorbidities, acute cardiac or kidney injury, lymphocytopenia and D-dimer conferred an increased risk of in-hospital death. With respect to the treatment of the acute phase, therapy with steroids was associated with the adverse composite endpoint (OR = 3.61, 95% CI 1.934-6.73), but not with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced age, comorbidities, abnormal inflammatory and organ injury circulating biomarkers captured patients with an adverse clinical outcome.

609,32722164,"The Nrf2-Keap1-ARE pathway is the principal regulator of antioxidant and phase II detoxification genes. Its activation increases the expression of antioxidant and cytoprotective proteins, protecting cells against infections. Nrf2 modulates virus-induced oxidative stress, ROS generation, and disease pathogenesis, which are vital in the viral life cycle. During respiratory viral infections, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), an inflammatory process, and oxidative stress of the epithelium lining cells activate the transcription factor Nrf2, which protects cells from oxidative stress and inflammation. Nrf2 reduces angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expression in respiratory epithelial cells. SARS-CoV2 has a high affinity for ACE2 that works as receptors for coronavirus surface spike glycoprotein, facilitating viral entry. Disease severity may also be modulated by pre-existing conditions, such as impaired immune response, obesity, and age, where decreased level of Nrf2 is a common feature. Consequently, Nrf2 activators may increase Nrf2 levels and enhance antiviral mediators' expression, which could initiate an ""antiviral state"", priming cells against viral infection. Therefore, this hypothesis paper describes the use of flavonoid supplements combined with vitamin D3 to activate Nrf2, which may be a potential target to prevent and/or decrease SARS-CoV-2 infection severity, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, enhancing innate immunity, and downregulating ACE2 receptors.","The Nrf2-Keap1-ARE pathway is the principal regulator of antioxidant and phase II detoxification genes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between different comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify studies reporting the rates of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients with severe/fatal outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to disease severity and the country of residence. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using random-effects models. RESULTS: A total of 34 eligible studies were identified. In patients with severe/fatal COVID-19, the most prevalent chronic comorbidities were obesity (42%, 95% CI 34-49%) and hypertension (40%, 95% CI 35-45%), followed by diabetes (17%, 95% CI 15-20%), cardiovascular disease (13%, 95% CI 11-15%), respiratory disease (8%, 95% CI 6-10%), cerebrovascular disease (6%, 95% CI 4-8%), malignancy (4%, 95% CI 3-6%), kidney disease (3%, 95% CI 2-4%), and liver disease (2%, 95% CI 1-3%). In order of the prediction, the pooled ORs of the comorbidities in patients with severe or fatal COVID-19 when compared to patients with non-severe/fatal COVID-19 were as follows: chronic respiratory disease, OR 3.56 (95% CI 2.87-4.41); hypertension, OR 3.17 (95% CI 2.46-4.08); cardiovascular disease, OR 3.13 (95% CI 2.65-3.70); kidney disease, OR 3.02 (95% CI 2.23-4.08); cerebrovascular disease, OR 2.74 (95% CI 1.59-4.74); malignancy, OR 2.73 (95% CI 1.73-4.21); diabetes, OR 2.63 (95% CI 2.08-3.33); and obesity, OR 1.72 (95% CI 1.04-2.85).

612,32712222,"BACKGROUND: Obesity was recently identified as a major risk factor for worse COVID-19 severity, especially among the young. The reason why its impact seems to be less pronounced in the elderly may be due to the concomitant presence of other comorbidities. However, all reports only focus on BMI, an indirect marker of body fat. AIM: To explore the impact on COVID-19 severity of abdominal fat as a marker of body composition easily collected in patients undergoing a chest CT scan. METHODS: Patients included in this retrospective study were consecutively enrolled among those admitted to an Emergency Department in Rome, Italy, who tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 and underwent a chest CT scan in March 2020. Data were extracted from electronic medical records. RESULTS: 150 patients were included (64.7% male, mean age 64+/-16years). Visceral fat (VAT) was significantly higher in patients requiring intensive care (p=0.032), together with age (p=0.009), inflammation markers CRP and LDH (p<0.0001, p=0.003, respectively), and interstitial pneumonia severity as assessed by a Lung Severity Score (LSS) (p<0.0001). Increasing age, lymphocytes, CRP, LDH, D-Dimer, LSS, total abdominal fat as well as VAT were found to have a significant univariate association with the need of intensive care. A multivariate analysis showed that LSS and VAT were independently associated with the need of intensive care (OR: 1.262; 95%CI: 1.0171-1.488; p=0.005 and OR: 2.474; 95%CI: 1.017-6.019; p=0.046, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: VAT is a marker of worse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with increased severity of Covid-19 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. We curated data from the electronic health record, and used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association of pre-existing traits with a Covid-19 illness severity defined by level of required care: need for hospital admission, need for intensive care, and need for intubation. SETTING: A large, multihospital healthcare system in Southern California. PARTICIPANTS: All patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection (N = 442). RESULTS: Of all patients studied, 48% required hospitalization, 17% required intensive care, and 12% required intubation. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, patients requiring a higher levels of care were more likely to be older (OR 1.5 per 10 years, P<0.001), male (OR 2.0, P = 0.001), African American (OR 2.1, P = 0.011), obese (OR 2.0, P = 0.021), with diabetes mellitus (OR 1.8, P = 0.037), and with a higher comorbidity index (OR 1.8 per SD, P<0.001).

617,32690352,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics and predictors of major outcomes in patients treated with tocilizumab (TCZ) for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case series of all sequential patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with TCZ at an Academic Spanish hospital (March 12 - May 2, 2020). Clinical outcomes: death, length of hospital stay. An early clinical response to TCZ (48-72 h after the administration) was assessed by variations in respiratory function markers, Brescia COVID Respiratory Severity Scale (BCRSS), inflammatory parameters, and patients' and physicians' opinion. Associations were tested by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: From a cohort of 236 patients, 77 patients treated with TCZ were included (median age 62 years (IQR 53.0-72.0), 64.9% were males), 42.9% had Charlson index >/=3; hypertension (41.6%), obesity (34.7%), and diabetes (20.8%).

619,32683613,"PURPOSE: Recent studies have demonstrated that obesity is significantly associated with increased disease severity, hospitalizations and mortality in COVID-19, with a potential role in the pathogenesis and prevalence in the new pandemic. The association with hepatic steatosis, however, a condition closely related to obesity within the spectrum of systemic metabolic dysfunctions, remains to be elucidated. We aimed to evaluate the frequency of hepatic steatosis as incidentally detected in chest CT examinations of COVID-19 positive patients in comparison to non-infected controls. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed with 316 patients (204 RT-PCR positive; 112 RT-PCR negative and chest CT negative). Steatosis was measured with placement of a single ROI in the right lobe of the liver (segments VI-VII) and defined as a liver attenuation value </= 40 HU. RESULTS: The frequency of hepatic steatosis was higher in the RT-PCR positive group in comparison to controls (31.9% vs. 7.1%, p < 0.001). Logistic linear regression analysis showed a 4.7 times odds of steatosis in the COVID-19 positive group as compared to controls after adjusting for age and sex (OR 4.698; 95% IC 2.12-10.41, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A significantly higher prevalence of steatosis was found among COVID-19 positive individuals. These findings are in accordance with other recent studies linking obesity and COVID-19 infection, as there is an intricate relationship between liver steatosis, metabolic syndrome and obesity. Further studies are required to confirm if such association remains after accounting for multiple variables, as well as possible relationships with disease severity and worst clinical outcomes.","PURPOSE: Recent studies have demonstrated that obesity is significantly associated with increased disease severity, hospitalizations and mortality in COVID-19, with a potential role in the pathogenesis and prevalence in the new pandemic.

621,32677752,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the association between adipose tissue distribution and severity of clinical course in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. METHODS: For this retrospective study, 143 hospitalized patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who underwent an unenhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan between January 1, 2020, and March 30, 2020, were included. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: There were 45 patients who were identified as critically ill. High visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio (called visceral adiposity) (odds ratio: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.05-5.98, P = 0.040) and low mean attenuation of skeletal muscle (called high intramuscular fat [IMF] deposition) (odds ratio: 11.90; 95% CI: 4.50-36.14; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for critical illness.

RESULTS: Of 482 patients, 104 (21.6%) had a BMI >/= 30 kg/m2. At logistic regression analysis, a BMI between 30 and 34.9 kg/m2 significantly increased the risk of respiratory failure (OR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.31-4.09, P = 0.004) and admission to the ICU (OR: 4.96; 95% CI: 2.53-9.74, P < 0.001). A significantly higher risk of death was observed in patients with a BMI >/= 35 kg/m2 (OR: 12.1; 95% CI: 3.25-45.1, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is a strong, independent risk factor for respiratory failure, admission to the ICU and death among COVID-19 patients. A BMI >/= 30 kg/m2 identifies a population of patients at high risk for severe illness, whereas a BMI >/= 35 kg/m2 dramatically increases the risk of death.","OBJECTIVE: Specific comorbidities and old age create a greater vulnerability to severe Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). While obesity seems to aggravate the course of disease, the actual impact of the BMI and the cutoff which increases illness severity are still under investigation. The aim of the study was to analyze whether the BMI represented a risk factor for respiratory failure, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and death.

623,32673651,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Overall obesity has recently been established as an independent risk factor for critical illness in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The role of fat distribution and especially that of visceral fat, which is often associated with metabolic syndrome, remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims at investigating the association between fat distribution and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Thirty patients with COVID-19 and a mean age of 65.6+/-13.1years from a level-one medical center in Berlin, Germany, were included in the present cross-sectional analysis. COVID-19 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasal and throat swabs. A severe clinical course of COVID-19 was defined by hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or invasive mechanical ventilation. Fat was measured at the level of the first lumbar vertebra on routinely acquired low-dose chest computed tomography (CT). RESULTS: An increase in visceral fat area (VFA) by ten square centimeters was associated with a 1.37-fold higher likelihood of ICU treatment and a 1.32-fold higher likelihood of mechanical ventilation (adjusted for age and sex). For upper abdominal circumference, each additional centimeter of circumference was associated with a 1.13-fold higher likelihood of ICU treatment and a 1.25-fold higher likelihood of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Our proof-of-concept study suggests that visceral adipose tissue and upper abdominal circumference specifically increase the likelihood of COVID-19 severity. CT-based quantification of visceral adipose tissue and upper abdominal circumference in routine chest CTs may therefore be a simple tool for risk assessment in COVID-19 patients.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Overall obesity has recently been established as an independent risk factor for critical illness in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

624,32671936,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recent pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus. Diabetes (mostly type 2 diabetes mellitus, T2DM) and hyperglycemia are among the major comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 leading to poor outcomes. Reports show that patients with diabetes and COVID-19 are at an increased risk for developing severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death. Here we explore potential mechanistic links that could explain the observed higher morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Patients with T2DM have an underlying increased level of inflammation associated with obesity and insulin resistance in addition to other comorbidities including hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, and being older. We review evidence that T2DM with hyperglycemia are among factors that lead to elevated expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in lungs and other tissues; ACE2 is the cellular ""receptor"" and port of viral entry. The preexisting chronic inflammation with augmented inflammatory response to the infection and the increasing viral load leads to extreme systemic immune response (""cytokine storm"") that is strongly associated with increased severity of COVID-19. Based on the available evidence, it is recommended by a panel of experts that safe but stringent control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipids be carried out in patients with T2DM, measures that could potentially serve to decrease the severity of COVID-19 should these patients contract the viral infection.

627,32654921,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and respiratory characteristics of a cohort of 43 patients with COVID-19 after an evolutive period of 28 days. DESIGN: A prospective, single-center observational study was carried out. SETTING: Intensive care. PATIENTS: Patients admitted due to COVID-19 and respiratory failure. INTERVENTIONS: None. VARIABLES: Automatic recording was made of demographic variables, severity parameters, laboratory data, assisted ventilation (HFO: high-flow oxygen therapy and IMV: invasive mechanical ventilation), oxygenation (PaO2, PaO2/FiO2) and complications. The patients were divided into three groups: survivors (G1), deceased (G2) and patients remaining under admission (G3). The chi-squared test or Fisher exact test (categorical variables) was used, along with the Mann-Whitney U-test or Wilcoxon test for analyzing the differences between medians. Statistical significance was considered for p<0.05. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were included (G1=28 [65.1%]; G2=10 [23.3%] and G3=5 [11.6%]), with a mean age of 65 years (range: 52-72), 62% males, APACHE II 18 (15-24), SOFA 6 (4-7). Arterial hypertension (30.2%) and obesity (25.6%) were the most frequent comorbidities. High-flow oxygen therapy was used in 62.7% of the patients, with failure in 85%. In turn, 95% of the patients required IMV and 85% received ventilation in prone decubitus. In the general population, initial PaO2/FiO2 improved after 7 days (165 [125-210] vs.194 [153-285]; p=0.02), in the same way as in G1 (164 [125-197] vs. 207 [160-294]; p=0.07), but not in G2 (163 [95-197] vs. 135 [85-177]). No bacterial coinfection was observed. The incidence of IMV-associated pneumonia was high (13 episodes/1000 days of IMV).

630,32650354,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread around the globe, infecting more than ten million individuals, with more than 500,000 dead; about one half of the infected people have recovered. Despite this fact, a subgroup of individuals affected by COVID-19 is at greater risk of developing worse outcomes and experience a high rate of mortality. Data on the association between obesity and COVID-19 are growing; the available studies, have reported a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in patients experiencing a severe COVID-19 course, with serious complications requiring hospitalization and admission to intensive care units. This paper attempts to highlight potential mechanisms behind the greater vulnerability to COVID-19 of individuals with obesity. The presence of uncontrolled chronic obesity-related comorbidities, particularly pulmonary diseases, can present a primary fertile soil for respiratory tract infection. Combined with immune system impairments, such as alteration in the T-cell proliferation and macrophage differentiation, and the high pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the adipose organ, this may worsen the general condition toward a systemic diffusion of infection. Prevention remains the first line of intervention in these patients that can be achieved by adhering to social distancing and adopting hygiene precautions, combined with a healthy lifestyle. Patients with obesity require preferential access dedicated to primary care services to ensure they are regularly taking their medications for the treatment of any concurrent chronic diseases. Finally, their physicians must promptly manage any medical signs or symptoms in the case of suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) infection to prevent the risk of severe outcomes.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread around the globe, infecting more than ten million individuals, with more than 500,000 dead; about one half of the infected people have recovered.

Prevention remains the first line of intervention in these patients that can be achieved by adhering to social distancing and adopting hygiene precautions, combined with a healthy lifestyle. Patients with obesity require preferential access dedicated to primary care services to ensure they are regularly taking their medications for the treatment of any concurrent chronic diseases. Finally, their physicians must promptly manage any medical signs or symptoms in the case of suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) infection to prevent the risk of severe outcomes.",Valerio A, O,Journal Article," The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)<br>pandemic has spread around the globe, infecting more<br>than ten million individuals, with more than<br>500,000 dead; about one half of the infected people have<br>recovered.

631,32645228,"COVID-19 is an outbreak of viral pneumonia which became a global health crisis, and the risk of morbidity and mortality of people with obesity are higher. SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen of COVID-19, enters into cells through binding to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) homolog-2 (ACE2). ACE2 is a regulator of two contrary pathways in renin angiotensin system (RAS): ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis and ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axis. Viral entry process eventuates in downregulation of ACE2 and subsequent activation of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis. ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis increases lipid storage, reduces white-to-beige fat conversion and plays role in obesity. Conversely, adipose tissue is an important source of angiotensin, and obesity results in increased systemic RAS. ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis, which has proinflammatory, profibrotic, prothrombotic, and vasoconstrictive effects, is potential mechanism of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The link between obesity and severe COVID-19 may be attributed to ACE2 consumption and subsequent ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis activation. Therefore, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may benefit from therapeutic strategies that activate ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axis, such as Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), Mas receptor agonists and ACE2.","COVID-19 is an outbreak of viral pneumonia which became a global health crisis, and the risk of morbidity and mortality of people with obesity are higher.

633,32640416,"INTRODUCTION: There have been recent mounting concerns regarding multiple reports stating a significantly elevated relative-risk of COVID-19 mortality amongst the Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) population. An urgent national enquiry investigating the possible reasons for this phenomenon has been issued in the UK. Inflammation is at the forefront of COVID-19 research as disease severity appears to correlate with pro-inflammatory cytokine dysregulation. This narrative review aims to shed light on the novel, pathophysiological role of inflammation in contributing towards the increased COVID-19 mortality risk amongst the BAME population. METHODS: Searches in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, medRxiv and Google Scholar were performed to identify articles published in English from inception to 18(th) June 2020. These databases were searched using keywords including: 'COVID-19' or 'Black and Minority Ethnic' or 'Inflammation'. A narrative review was synthesized using these included articles. RESULTS: We suggest a novel pathophysiological mechanism by which acute inflammation from COVID-19 may augment existing chronic inflammation, in order to potentiate a 'cytokine storm' and thus the more severe disease phenotype observed in the BAME population. Obesity, insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, psychological stress, chronic infections and genetic predispositions are all relevant factors which may be contributing to elevated chronic systemic inflammation amongst the BAME population. CONCLUSION: Overall, this review provides early insights and directions for ongoing research regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain the severe COVID-19 disease phenotype observed amongst the BAME population. We suggest 'personalization' of chronic disease management, which can be used with other interventions, in order to tackle this.","INTRODUCTION: There have been recent mounting concerns regarding multiple reports stating a significantly elevated relative-risk of COVID-19 mortality amongst the Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) population.

We examined the association between male sex and severe COVID-19 infection and if an increased risk remains after adjustment for age and comorbidities. METHODS: Nationwide register-based follow-up study of COVID-19 patients in Denmark until 16 May 2020. Average risk ratio comparing 30-day composite outcome of all-cause death, severe COVID-19 diagnosis or intensive care unit (ICU) admission for men versus women standardized to the age and comorbidity distribution of all patients were derived from multivariable Cox regression. Included covariates were age, hypertension, diagnoses including obesity, alcohol, sleep apnea, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke, peripheral artery disease, cancer, liver, rheumatic, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). RESULTS: Of 4842 COVID-19 patients, 2281 (47.1%) were men. Median age was 57 [25%-75% 43-73] for men versus 52 [38-71] for women (P < .001); however, octogenarians had equal sex distribution. Alcohol diagnosis, diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, prior MI and IHD (all P < .001) as well as AF, stroke, and HF (all P = .01) were more often seen in men, and so was CKD (P = .03).

637,32613681,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection ranges from asymptomatic through to fatal COVID-19 characterized by a 'cytokine storm' and lung failure. Vitamin D deficiency has been postulated as a determinant of severity. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence relevant to vitamin D and COVID-19. METHODS: Narrative review. RESULTS: Regression modelling shows that more northerly countries in the Northern Hemisphere are currently (May 2020) showing relatively high COVID-19 mortality, with an estimated 4.4% increase in mortality for each 1 degree latitude north of 28 degrees North (P = 0.031) after adjustment for age of population. This supports a role for ultraviolet B acting via vitamin D synthesis. Factors associated with worse COVID-19 prognosis include old age, ethnicity, male sex, obesity, diabetes and hypertension and these also associate with deficiency of vitamin D or its response. Vitamin D deficiency is also linked to severity of childhood respiratory illness. Experimentally, vitamin D increases the ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to ACE, thus increasing angiotensin II hydrolysis and reducing subsequent inflammatory cytokine response to pathogens and lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial evidence supports a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity but it is all indirect. Community-based placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation may be difficult. Further evidence could come from study of COVID-19 outcomes in large cohorts with information on prescribing data for vitamin D supplementation or assay of serum unbound 25(OH) vitamin D levels. Meanwhile, vitamin D supplementation should be strongly advised for people likely to be deficient.","BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection ranges from asymptomatic through to fatal COVID-19 characterized by a 'cytokine storm' and lung failure.

638,32610364,"OBJECTIVE: This study's aim was to explore the association of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on admission. METHODS: In the present study, a total of 23,593 patient samples were evaluated by a laboratory from the Mexican Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference. Of these, 18,443 were negative for COVID-19, 3,844 were positive for COVID-19, and 1,306 were positive for other respiratory viruses. Severe types of respiratory disease were defined by the presence of pneumonia and other organ failure that requires intensive care. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore factors associated with severe COVID-19 on admission. RESULTS: Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 had a higher proportion of obesity (17.4%), diabetes (14.5%), and hypertension (18.9%) compared with those without a confirmed diagnosis. Compared with patients without obesity, those with obesity showed a 1.43-fold higher odds of developing severe COVID-19 on admission, whereas subjects with diabetes and hypertension showed a 1.87-fold and 1.77-fold higher odds of developing severe COVID-19 on admission, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, diabetes, and hypertension were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission and the association of obesity was stronger in patients < 50 years of age.","OBJECTIVE: This study's aim was to explore the association of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on admission.

641,32602202,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the indicators for severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in young patients between the ages of 18 and 40 years. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 65 consecutively admitted patients with COVID-19 who were between 18 and 40 years old in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China. Among them, 53 were moderate cases, and 12 were severe or critical cases. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment data were collected. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to explore risk factors. RESULTS: The patients with severe/critical cases had obviously higher BMI (average 29.23 vs. 22.79 kg/m(2) ) and lower liver computed tomography value (average 50.00 vs. 65.00 mU) than the group of moderate cases. The patients with severe/critical cases had higher fasting glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine compared with patients with moderate cases (all P < 0.01). More severe/critical cases (58.33% vs. 1.92%) had positive urine protein levels. The severe/critical cases also experienced a significant process of serum albumin decline. Logistic regression analysis showed that male sex, high BMI (especially obesity), elevated fasting blood glucose, and urinary protein positivity were all risk factors for young patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is an important predictor of COVID-19 severity in young patients. The main mechanism is related to damage of the liver and kidney.","OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the indicators for severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in young patients between the ages of 18 and 40 years.

642,32598450,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on older adults. Mexico's population is younger, yet COVID-19's impact on older adults is comparable to countries with older population structures. Here, we aim to identify health and structural determinants that increase susceptibility to COVID-19 in older Mexican adults beyond chronological aging. METHODS: We analyzed confirmed COVID-19 cases in older adults using data from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health. We modeled risk factors for increased COVID-19 severity and mortality, using mixed models to incorporate multilevel data concerning healthcare access and marginalization. We also evaluated structural factors and comorbidity profiles compared to chronological age for COVID-19 mortality risk prediction. RESULTS: We analyzed 20 804 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in adults aged 60 and older. Male sex, smoking, diabetes, and obesity were associated with pneumonia, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission in older adults, CKD and COPD were associated with hospitalization. High social lag indexes and access to private care were predictors of COVID-19 severity and mortality. Age was not a predictor of COVID-19 severity in individuals without comorbidities and combination of structural factors and comorbidities were better predictors of COVID-19 lethality and severity compared to chronological age alone. COVID-19 baseline lethality hazards were heterogeneously distributed across Mexican municipalities, particularly when comparing urban and rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: Structural factors and comorbidity explain excess risk for COVID-19 severity and mortality over chronological age in older Mexican adults. Clinical decision-making related to COVID-19 should focus away from chronological aging onto more a comprehensive geriatric care approach.","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on older adults.

643,32591714,"On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organisation identified COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, to be a global emergency.

These risk factors, however, do not account for the other 52% of deaths arising from COVID-19 in often seemingly healthy individuals. This paper investigates the potential link between SARS-CoV-2 and bacterial load, questioning whether bacteria may play a role in bacterial superinfections and complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis.

644,32589189,"Importance: Risk factors associated with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are unknown. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) may modify the risk of developing a severe COVID-19 infection, beside identified risk factors such as age and comorbidities. Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with MS and COVID-19 and identify factors associated with COVID-19 severity. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Covisep registry is a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study conducted in MS expert centers and general hospitals and with neurologists collaborating with MS expert centers and members of the Societe Francophone de la Sclerose en Plaques. The study included patients with MS presenting with a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and May 21, 2020. Exposures: COVID-19 diagnosed with a polymerase chain reaction test on a nasopharyngeal swab, thoracic computed tomography, or typical symptoms. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was COVID-19 severity assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1 [not hospitalized with no limitations on activities] to 7 [death]) with a cutoff at 3 (hospitalized and not requiring supplemental oxygen). We collected demographics, neurological history, Expanded Disability Severity Scale score (EDSS; ranging from 0 to 10, with cutoffs at 3 and 6), comorbidities, COVID-19 characteristics, and outcomes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of collected variables with COVID-19 outcomes. Results: A total of 347 patients (mean [SD] age, 44.6 [12.8] years, 249 women; mean [SD] disease duration, 13.5 [10.0] years) were analyzed. Seventy-three patients (21.0%) had a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more, and 12 patients (3.5%) died of COVID-19. The median EDSS was 2.0 (range, 0-9.5), and 284 patients (81.8%) were receiving DMT. There was a higher proportion of patients with a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more among patients with no DMT relative to patients receiving DMTs (46.0% vs 15.5%; P < .001). Multivariate logistic regression models determined that age (odds ratio per 10 years: 1.9 [95% CI, 1.4-2.5]), EDSS (OR for EDSS >/=6, 6.3 [95% CI. 2.8-14.4]), and obesity (OR, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.0-8.7]) were independent risk factors for a COVID-19 severity score of 3 or more (indicating hospitalization or higher severity). The EDSS was associated with the highest variability of COVID-19 severe outcome (R2, 0.2), followed by age (R2, 0.06) and obesity (R2, 0.01). Conclusions and Relevance: In this registry-based cohort study of patients with MS, age, EDSS, and obesity were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19; there was no association found between DMTs exposure and COVID-19 severity. The identification of these risk factors should provide the rationale for an individual strategy regarding clinical management of patients with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Importance: Risk factors associated with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are unknown.

647,32584326,"BACKGROUND: Regional information regarding the characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is needed for a better understanding of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 patients diagnosed in a tertiary-care center in Mexico City and to assess differences according to the treatment setting (ambulatory vs. hospital) and to the need of intensive care (IC). METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort, including consecutive patients with COVID-19 from February 26, 2020 to April 11, 2020. RESULTS: We identified 309 patients (140 inpatients and 169 outpatients). The median age was 43 years (interquartile range, 33-54), 59.2% men, and 18.6% healthcare workers (12.3% from our center). The median body mass index (BMI) was 29.00 kg/m(2) and 39.6% had obesity. Compared to outpatients, inpatients were older, had comorbidities, cough, and dyspnea more frequently. Twenty-nine (20.7%) inpatients required treatment in the IC unit (ICU). History of diabetes (type 1 or 2) and abdominal pain were more common in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients.

DESIGN: We conducted an international prospective study across Europe on liver transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by microbiological assay during the first outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, management of immunosuppressive therapy and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: 57 patients were included (70% male, median (IQR) age at diagnosis 65 (57-70) years). 21 (37%), 32 (56%) and 21 (37%) patients had one cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, respectively.

It appears that lipid-lowering pharmacological interventions, in particular statins, might reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications caused by COVID-19 and might potentially have an additional antiviral activity. It has been shown that high cholesterol levels are associated with more lipid rafts, subdomains of the plasma membrane that can harbour angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2. Evidence of the importance of cholesterol for viral entry into host cells could suggest a role for cholesterol-lowering therapies in reducing viral infectivity. In addition to their lipid-lowering and plaque-stabilisation effects, statins possess pleiotropic effects including anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antithrombotic activities. Lower rates of mortality and intubation have been reported in studies investigating statin therapy in influenza infection, and statin therapy was shown to increase viral clearance from the blood during chronic hepatitis C infection. Statins may also serve as potential SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors, thereby contributing to the control of viral infection. In this review, we elaborate on the role of cholesterol level in the process of the coronavirus infection and provide a critical appraisal on the potential of statins in reducing the severity, duration, and complications of COVID-19.","Current data suggest that infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) seems to follow a more severe clinical course in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, and overweight/obesity.

Current data show that COVID-19 is associated with increased disease severity in individuals with obesity. Obesity is usually associated with dysregulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) axis. RAAS has also been implicated in acute lung injury as well as myocardial injury and has thus attracted interest as a potential regulator of COVID-19 severity. Whilst research all over the world is still struggling to provide a detailed characterization of the biology of SARS-CoV2 and its associated disease profile, it has become evident that SARS-CoV2 uses the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell internalization. ACE2 is a protective component of the RAAS axis and is downregulated after SARS-CoV2 infection. The RAAS axis could thus be a link between obesity and COVID-19 severity; therefore, more accurate understanding of the underlying mechanisms would be needed with the hope of proposing efficient therapeutic interventions.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory distress coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is a rapidly evolving pandemic challenging the world and posing unprecedented public health issues.

654,32560658,"COVID-19 is an infection induced by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and severe forms can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) management. Severe forms are associated with coagulation changes, mainly characterized by an increase in D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, with a higher risk of thrombosis, particularly pulmonary embolism. The impact of obesity in severe COVID-19 has also been highlighted.In this context, standard doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may be inadequate in ICU patients, with obesity, major inflammation, and hypercoagulability. We therefore urgently developed proposals on the prevention of thromboembolism and monitoring of hemostasis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.Four levels of thromboembolic risk were defined according to the severity of COVID-19 reflected by oxygen requirement and treatment, the body mass index, and other risk factors. Monitoring of hemostasis (including fibrinogen and D-dimer levels) every 48 h is proposed. Standard doses of LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 4000 IU/24 h SC) are proposed in case of intermediate thrombotic risk (BMI < 30 kg/m(2), no other risk factors and no ARDS). In all obese patients (high thrombotic risk), adjusted prophylaxis with intermediate doses of LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 4000 IU/12 h SC or 6000 IU/12 h SC if weight > 120 kg), or unfractionated heparin (UFH) if renal insufficiency (200 IU/kg/24 h, IV), is proposed. The thrombotic risk was defined as very high in obese patients with ARDS and added risk factors for thromboembolism, and also in case of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), unexplained catheter thrombosis, dialysis filter thrombosis, or marked inflammatory syndrome and/or hypercoagulability (e.g., fibrinogen > 8 g/l and/or D-dimers > 3 mug/ml). In ICU patients, it is sometimes difficult to confirm a diagnosis of thrombosis, and curative anticoagulant treatment may also be discussed on a probabilistic basis. In all these situations, therapeutic doses of LMWH, or UFH in case of renal insufficiency with monitoring of anti-Xa activity, are proposed.In conclusion, intensification of heparin treatment should be considered in the context of COVID-19 on the basis of clinical and biological criteria of severity, especially in severely ill ventilated patients, for whom the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism cannot be easily confirmed.","COVID-19 is an infection induced by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and severe forms can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) management.

Patients who received hydroxychloroquine (200 mg 3 times daily dosage for 10 days) on a compassionate basis in addition to standard of care (SOC) were compared with patients without contraindications to hydroxychloroquine who received SOC alone. A propensity score-weighted analysis was performed to control for confounders: age, sex, time between symptom onset and admission </= 7 days, Charlson comorbidity index, medical history of arterial hypertension, obesity, National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) score at admission, and pneumonia severity. The primary endpoint was time to unfavorable outcome, defined as: death, admission to an intensive care unit, or decision to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatments, whichever came first. RESULTS: Data from 89 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed, 84 of whom were considered in the primary analysis; 38 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and 46 patients treated with SOC alone. At admission, the mean age of patients was 66 years, the median Charlson comorbidity index was 3, and the median NEWS2 severity score was 3. After propensity score weighting, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a significantly reduced risk of unfavorable outcome (hazard ratio, 0.90 [95% confidence interval, .38-2.1], P = .81). Overall survival was not significantly different between the 2 groups (hazard ratio, 0.89 [0.23; 3.47], P = 1). CONCLUSION: In hospitalized adults with COVID-19, no significant reduction of the risk of unfavorable outcomes was observed with hydroxychloroquine in comparison to SOC. Unmeasured confounders may have persisted however, despite careful propensity-weighted analysis and the study might be underpowered. Ongoing controlled trials in patients with varying degrees of initial severity on a larger scale will help determine whether there is a place for hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19.

658,32555034,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and birth outcomes of women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as community spread in New York City was detected in March 2020. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who gave birth from March 13 to April 12, 2020, identified at five New York City medical centers. Demographic and clinical data from delivery hospitalization records were collected, and follow-up was completed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS: Among this cohort (241 women), using evolving criteria for testing, 61.4% of women were asymptomatic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the time of admission. Throughout the delivery hospitalization, 26.5% of women met World Health Organization criteria for mild COVID-19, 26.1% for severe, and 5% for critical. Cesarean birth was the mode of delivery for 52.4% of women with severe and 91.7% with critical COVID-19. The singleton preterm birth rate was 14.6%. Admission to the intensive care unit was reported for 17 women (7.1%), and nine (3.7%) were intubated during their delivery hospitalization. There were no maternal deaths. Body mass index (BMI) 30 or higher was associated with COVID-19 severity (P=.001). Nearly all newborns tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection immediately after birth (97.5%). CONCLUSION: During the first month of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in New York City and with evolving testing criteria, most women with laboratory-confirmed infection admitted for delivery did not have symptoms of COVID-19. Almost one third of women who were asymptomatic on admission became symptomatic during their delivery hospitalization. Obesity was associated with COVID-19 severity. Disease severity was associated with higher rates of cesarean and preterm birth.","OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and birth outcomes of women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as community spread in New York City was detected in March 2020.

659,32554082,"BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that patients with moderate to severe asthma belong to a high-risk group that is susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the association between asthma and COVID-19 has not been well-established. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to determine the prevalence of asthma among patients with COVID-19 in a major US health system. We assessed the clinical characteristics and comorbidities in asthmatic and nonasthmatic patients with COVID-19. We also determined the risk of hospitalization associated with asthma and/or inhaled corticosteroid use. METHODS: Medical records of patients with COVID-19 were searched by a computer algorithm (March 1 to April 15, 2020), and chart review was used to validate the diagnosis of asthma and medications prescribed for asthma. All patients had PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Demographic and clinical features were characterized. Regression models were used to assess the associations between asthma and corticosteroid use and the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 1526 patients identified with COVID-19, 220 (14%) were classified as having asthma. Asthma was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.19) after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. The ongoing use of inhaled corticosteroids did not increase the risk of hospitalization in a similar adjusted model (relative risk, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.90-2.15). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a substantial prevalence of asthma in our COVID-19 cohort, asthma was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization. Similarly, the use of inhaled corticosteroids with or without systemic corticosteroids was not associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization.","BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that patients with moderate to severe asthma belong to a high-risk group that is susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

660,32553130,"BACKGROUND: The risk of severe COVID-19 if an individual becomes infected is known to be higher in older individuals and those with underlying health conditions. Understanding the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and how this varies between countries should inform the design of possible strategies to shield or vaccinate those at highest risk. METHODS: We estimated the number of individuals at increased risk of severe disease (defined as those with at least one condition listed as ""at increased risk of severe COVID-19"" in current guidelines) by age (5-year age groups), sex, and country for 188 countries using prevalence data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 and UN population estimates for 2020. The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 was determined by mapping the conditions listed in GBD 2017 to those listed in guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and the USA. We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity. To help interpretation of the degree of risk among those at increased risk, we also estimated the number of individuals at high risk (defined as those that would require hospital admission if infected) using age-specific infection-hospitalisation ratios for COVID-19 estimated for mainland China and making adjustments to reflect country-specific differences in the prevalence of underlying conditions and frailty. We assumed males were twice at likely as females to be at high risk. We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at increased risk because of their age, using minimum ages from 50 to 70 years. We generated uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates by running low and high scenarios using the lower and upper 95% confidence limits for country population size, disease prevalences, multimorbidity fractions, and infection-hospitalisation ratios, and plausible low and high estimates for the degree of clustering, informed by multimorbidity studies. FINDINGS: We estimated that 1.7 billion (UI 1.0-2.4) people, comprising 22% (UI 15-28) of the global population, have at least one underlying condition that puts them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 if infected (ranging from <5% of those younger than 20 years to >66% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated that 349 million (186-787) people (4% [3-9] of the global population) are at high risk of severe COVID-19 and would require hospital admission if infected (ranging from <1% of those younger than 20 years to approximately 20% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated 6% (3-12) of males to be at high risk compared with 3% (2-7) of females. The share of the population at increased risk was highest in countries with older populations, African countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence, and small island nations with high diabetes prevalence. Estimates of the number of individuals at increased risk were most sensitive to the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease. INTERPRETATION: About one in five individuals worldwide could be at increased risk of severe COVID-19, should they become infected, due to underlying health conditions, but this risk varies considerably by age. Our estimates are uncertain, and focus on underlying conditions rather than other risk factors such as ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and obesity, but provide a starting point for considering the number of individuals that might need to be shielded or vaccinated as the global pandemic unfolds.

662,32542111,"Clozapine is the only available treatment for refractory schizophrenia but its use involves frequent physical contact with healthcare workers for the purpose of mandatory blood monitoring. During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients taking clozapine will be self-isolating to reduce the risk of infection, not least because these patients are at high risk of serious illness and fatality because of high rates of diabetes, obesity and pulmonary disease and an increased risk of pneumonia. Problems may also arise because both clozapine-induced myocarditis and neutropenic sepsis share signs and symptoms with COVID-19 (fever, chest pain, dyspnoea, etc.). We recommend decreasing the frequency of physical contacts by extending the blood monitoring interval to 12 weeks in those patients taking clozapine for more than 1 year. To distinguish COVID-19 from clozapine-related physical adverse effects, we suggest an urgent antigen test alongside a full blood count. In those taking clozapine who develop COVID-19, we suggest continuing with clozapine whenever possible (even during ventilation), reducing the dose if necessary in line with blood assay results. Blood monitoring should continue but clozapine should only cease if there is a significant fall in neutrophils (COVID-19 is linked to lymphopenia but not neutropenia). To protect against the likelihood and severity of respiratory infection, we recommend the use of vitamin D in all clozapine patients. Initiation of clozapine is likely to remain problematic while the risk of infection remains, given the degree of physical contact required to assure safety.","Clozapine is the only available treatment for refractory schizophrenia but its use involves frequent physical contact with healthcare workers for the purpose of mandatory blood monitoring.

664,32540733,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have comorbidities related to metabolic syndrome (MS) during the disease course. Its presence in different ethnicities and continents places MS as an important risk factor for COVID-19. Adequate understanding of the interplay between MS, COVID-19 and proposed therapies is required for optimum management of these patients. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases until June 1st, 2020 and accessed the full text on COVID-19 and MS to prepare a narrative review on this topic. RESULTS: Patients with metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and liver disease may face a higher risk of infection of COVID-19, greatly affecting the development and prognosis of the disease, being associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients. The proposed drugs that are in clinical trial for COVID-19 treatment must be carefully considered for clinical use, especially in patients with MS. CONCLUSION: MS is a risk factor influencing the progression and prognosis of COVID-2019. The drugs currently evaluated for the infection treatment are promising but need further studies to prove their efficacy and safety, due to the adverse effects may be exacerbated by combination therapy or due to viral infection. The development of a vaccine for immunization is still the best long-term solution.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have comorbidities related to metabolic syndrome (MS) during the disease course.

668,32519944,"BACKGROUND: The type of pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) that is caused by the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) is now spreading across the world in a pandemic. Many patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the University Hospital Aachen during an outbreak that first struck the Heinsberg district in February 2020. METHODS: A comparative presentation of the clinical features of the first 50 COVID-19 patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were hospitalized in the University Hospital Aachen. RESULTS: 24 intubated patients were treated in the intensive care unit for ARDS of varying degrees of severity, while 26 patients who were breathing spontaneously without ARDS, but nevertheless needed supplemental oxygen, were treated in a separate isolation ward. The median age of the patients was 65 (IQR 58-76). The median latency from symptom onset to hospitalization was four days (IQR 1-8). Patients with ARDS had preexisting respiratory diseases more commonly than patients without ARDS (58% [95% confidence interval: 39; 76] versus 42% [26; 61]) and were more commonly overweight or obese (83% [64; 93] versus 42% [26; 61]). The two groups did not differ in viral burden but displayed significant differences in laboratory findings: ARDS patients had persistently elevated values for leukocytes, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and D-dimers over the period of observation. Patients without ARDS had persistently elevated inflammatory parameters and fever for at least one week, with an accompanying need for supplemental oxygen. Three of the patients with ARDS died of multiorgan failure, while four in the non-ARDS group died of respiratory insufficiency. CONCLUSION: This initial description of a cohort of COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS in Germany reveals that those with ARDS more commonly have preexisting respiratory diseases and obesity, as well as persistently elevated inflammatory markers. COVID-19 patients without ARDS may likewise require prolonged hospitalization because of persistently elevated inflammatory values with a simultaneous need for supplemental oxygen.","BACKGROUND: The type of pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) that is caused by the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) is now spreading across the world in a pandemic.

Use of critical CYP3A4 substrate drugs such as warfarin. *Women of child bearing age may participate if they use a safe contraceptive method for the entire period of the study and at least one month afterwards. A woman is considered to not have childbearing capacity if she is post-menopausal (minimum of 2 years without menstruation) or has undergone surgical sterilization (at least one month before the study). The trial is currently planned at a single center, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, in Navarra (Spain), and the immunology samples will be analyzed at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), in Barcelona (Spain). Participants will be recruited by the investigators at the emergency room and/or COVID-19 area of the CUN. They will remain in the trial for a period of 28 days at their homes since they will be patients with mild disease. In the interest of public health and to contain transmission of infection, follow-up visits will be conducted in the participant's home by a clinical trial team comprising nursing and medical members. Home visits will assess clinical and laboratory parameters of the patients. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Ivermectin will be administered to the treatment group at a 400mug/Kg dose (included in the EU approved label of Stromectol and Scabioral). The control group will receive placebo. There is no current data on the efficacy of ivermectin against the virus in vivo, therefore the use of placebo in the control group is ethically justified. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary Proportion of patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab at day 7 post-treatment. Secondary 1.Mean viral load as determined by PCR cycle threshold (Ct) at baseline and on days 4, 7, 14, and 21.2.Proportion of patients with fever and cough at days 4, 7, 14, and 21 as well as proportion of patients progressing to severe disease or death during the trial.3.Proportion of patients with seroconversion at day 21.4.Proportion of drug-related adverse events during the trial.5.Median levels of IgG, IgM, IgA measured by Luminex, frequencies of innate and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells assessed by flow cytometry, median levels of inflammatory and activation markers measured by Luminex and transcriptomics.6.Median kinetics of IgG, IgM, IgA levels during the trial, until day 28. RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio using a randomization list generated by the trial statistician using blocks of four to ensure balance between the groups. A study identification code with the format ""SAINT-##"" (##: from 01 to 24) will be generated using a sequence of random numbers so that the randomization number does not match the subject identifier. The sequence and code used will be kept in an encrypted file accessible only to the trial statistician. A physical copy will be kept in a locked cabinet at the CUN, accessible only to the person administering the drug who will not enrol or attend to patient care. A separate set of 24 envelopes for emergency unblinding will be kept in the study file. BLINDING (MASKING): The clinical trial team and the patients will be blinded. The placebo will not be visibly identical, but it will be administered by staff not involved in the clinical care or participant follow up. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size is 24 patients: 12 participants will be randomised to the treatment group and 12 participants to the control group.

Secondary 1.Mean viral load as determined by PCR cycle threshold (Ct) at baseline and on days 4, 7, 14, and 21.2.Proportion of patients with fever and cough at days 4, 7, 14, and 21 as well as proportion of patients progressing to severe disease or death during the trial.3.Proportion of patients with seroconversion at day 21.4.Proportion of drug-related adverse events during the trial.5.Median levels of IgG, IgM, IgA measured by Luminex, frequencies of innate and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells assessed by flow cytometry, median levels of inflammatory and activation markers measured by Luminex and transcriptomics.6.Median kinetics of IgG, IgM, IgA levels during the trial, until day 28. RANDOMISATION: Eligible patients will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio using a randomization list generated by the trial statistician using blocks of four to ensure balance between the groups. A study identification code with the format ""SAINT-##"" (##: from 01 to 24) will be generated using a sequence of random numbers so that the randomization number does not match the subject identifier. The sequence and code used will be kept in an encrypted file accessible only to the trial statistician. A physical copy will be kept in a locked cabinet at the CUN, accessible only to the person administering the drug who will not enrol or attend to patient care. A separate set of 24 envelopes for emergency unblinding will be kept in the study file. BLINDING (MASKING): The clinical trial team and the patients will be blinded. The placebo will not be visibly identical, but it will be administered by staff not involved in the clinical care or participant follow up. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The sample size is 24 patients: 12 participants will be randomised to the treatment group and 12 participants to the control group. TRIAL STATUS: Current protocol version: 1.0 dated 16 of April 2020. Recruitment is envisioned to begin by May 14th and end by June 14th.

673,32505805,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the course over time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in French women from the beginning of the pandemic until mid-April, the risk profile of women with respiratory complications, and short-term pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: We collected a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 in a research network of 33 French maternity units between March 1 and April 14, 2020. All cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a positive result on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests of a nasal sample and/or diagnosed by a computed tomography chest scan were included and analyzed. The primary outcome measures were COVID-19 requiring oxygen (oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation) and critical COVID-19 (requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ECMO). Demographic data, baseline comorbidities, and pregnancy outcomes were also collected. RESULTS: Active cases of COVID-19 increased exponentially during March 1-31, 2020; the numbers fell during April 1-14, after lockdown was imposed on March 17. The shape of the curve of active critical COVID-19 mirrored that of all active cases. By April 14, among the 617 pregnant women with COVID-19, 93 women (15.1 %; 95 %CI 12.3-18.1) had required oxygen therapy and 35 others (5.7 %; 95 %CI 4.0-7.8) had had a critical form of COVID-19. The severity of the disease was associated with age older than 35 years and obesity, as well as preexisting diabetes, previous preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. One woman with critical COVID-19 died (0.2 %; 95 %CI 0-0.9). Among the women who gave birth, rates of preterm birth in women with non-severe, oxygen-requiring, and critical COVID-19 were 13/123 (10.6 %), 14/29 (48.3 %), and 23/29 (79.3 %) before 37 weeks and 3/123 (2.4 %), 4/29 (13.8 %), and 14/29 (48.3 %) before 32 weeks, respectively. One neonate (0.5 %; 95 %CI 0.01-2.9) in the critical group died from prematurity. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can be responsible for significant rates of severe acute, potentially deadly, respiratory distress syndromes. The most vulnerable pregnant women, those with comorbidities, may benefit particularly from prevention measures such as a lockdown.","OBJECTIVE: To describe the course over time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in French women from the beginning of the pandemic until mid-April, the risk profile of women with respiratory complications, and short-term pregnancy outcomes.

The recent emerging evidence of coagulation disorders in COVID-19 suggests that vasculopathy appears to be an independent risk factor promoting disease severity and mortality of affected patients.

677,32497535,"The most severe presentation of COVID-19 is characterized by a hyperinflammatory state attributed to the massive pro-inflammatory cytokine release, called ""cytokine storm"". Several specific anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive agents are being evaluated by ongoing clinical trials; however, there is currently insufficient evidence for their efficacy and safety in COVID-19 treatment. Given the role of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE) 4 and cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the inflammatory response, we hypothesize that selective PDE4 inhibition may attenuate the cytokine storm in COVID-19, through the upstream inhibition of pro-inflammatory molecules, particularly TNF-alpha, and the regulation of the pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance. Conversely, other anti-cytokine agents lead to the downstream inhibition of specific targets, such as IL-1, IL-6 or TNF-alpha, and may not be efficient in blocking the cytokine storm, once it has been triggered. Due to their mechanism of action targeting an early stage of the inflammatory response and ameliorating lung inflammation, we believe that selective PDE4 inhibitors may represent a promising treatment option for the early phase of COVID-19 pneumonia before the cytokine storm and severe multiorgan dysfunction take place. Furthermore, PDE4 inhibitors present several advantages including an excellent safety profile; the oral route of administration; the convenient dosing; and beneficial metabolic properties. Interestingly, obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2 have been reported to be risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. Therefore, randomized clinical trials of PDE4 inhibitors are necessary to explore their potential therapeutic effect as an adjunct to supportive measures and other therapeutic regiments.","The most severe presentation of COVID-19 is characterized by a hyperinflammatory state attributed to the massive pro-inflammatory cytokine release, called ""cytokine storm"".

678,32496587,"BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is accelerating worldwide, and novel clinical presentations of COVID-19 are often reported. The range of human cells and tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, its potential receptors and associated regulating factors are still largely unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of known and potential SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related molecules in the extensive collection of primary human cells and tissues from healthy subjects of different age and from patients with risk factors and known comorbidities of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing and explored available RNA-Seq databases to study gene expression and co-expression of ACE2, CD147 (BSG), and CD26 (DPP4) and their direct and indirect molecular partners in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial and skin biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, neutrophils, DCs, NK cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, B cells, and plasmablasts. We analyzed the material from healthy children and adults, and from adults in relation to their disease or COVID-19 risk factor status. RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA andPPIB), CD26 (DPP4), and related molecules were expressed in both epithelium and in immune cells. We also observed a distinct age-related expression profile of these genes in the PBMCs and T cells from healthy children and adults. Asthma, COPD, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and male gender status generally led to the higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the bronchial biopsy, BAL, or blood. Additionally, CD147-related genes correlated positively with age and BMI. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression of CD147-related genes in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest different receptor repertoire potentially involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection at the epithelial barriers and in the immune cells. Altered expression of these receptors related to age, gender, obesity and smoking, as well as with the disease status, might contribute to COVID-19 morbidity and severity patterns.","BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is accelerating worldwide, and novel clinical presentations of COVID-19 are often reported.

680,32492562,"It is widely believed that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers a disproportionate immune response which causes a devastating systemic injury, particularly in individuals with obesity, itself a chronic, multi-organ inflammatory disease. Immune cells accumulate in visceral adipose tissue and together with paracrine adipocytes release a wide range of biologically active cytokines (including IL-1beta, IL5, IL6 and IL8) that can result in both local, pulmonary and systemic inflammation. A more intense 'cytokine storm' is postulated as the mechanism behind the extreme immune response seen in severe COVID-19. It is striking how dangerous the combination of obesity and COVID-19 is, resulting in a greater risk of ICU admission and a higher mortality. Furthermore, patients from a BAME background appear to have increased mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection; they also have a higher prevalence of central obesity and its metabolic complications. In the absence of an effective vaccine, the therapeutic potential of immune-modulating drugs is a priority, but the development of new drugs is expensive and time-consuming. A more pragmatic solution would be to seek to repurpose existing drugs, particularly those that might suppress the heightened cytokine activity seen in obesity, the major risk factor for a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist licensed to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis. It has been shown to diminish pulmonary response to antigen, tissue eosinophilia and IL-5 expression in inflammatory cells. It has also been shown to decrease elevated levels of IL-1beta and IL8 in humans with viral upper respiratory tract infections compared with placebo-treated patients. In addition, in silico studies have demonstrated a high binding affinity of the montelukast molecule to the terminal site of the virus's main protease enzyme which is needed for virus RNA synthesis and replication. Montelukast, which is cheap, safe and widely available would appear to have the potential to be an ideal candidate drug for clinical trials, particularly in early stage disease before irreparable tissue damage has already occurred. HYPOTHESIS: Through a direct anti-viral effect, or by suppression of heightened cytokine release in response to SARS-CoV-2, montelukast will reduce the severity of immune-mediated multiorgan damage resulting from COVID-19, particularly in patients with central obesity and metabolic syndrome.","It is widely believed that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers a disproportionate immune response which causes a devastating systemic injury, particularly in individuals with obesity, itself a chronic, multi-organ inflammatory disease.

Objective: To describe the epidemiology, clinical, and laboratory features of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at a children's hospital and to compare these parameters between patients hospitalized with and without severe disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective review of electronic medical records from a tertiary care academically affiliated children's hospital in New York City, New York, included hospitalized children and adolescents (</=21 years) who were tested based on suspicion for COVID-19 between March 1 to April 15, 2020, and had positive results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Exposures: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal specimen using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severe disease as defined by the requirement for mechanical ventilation. Results: Among 50 patients, 27 (54%) were boys and 25 (50%) were Hispanic. The median days from onset of symptoms to admission was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-5 days). Most patients (40 [80%]) had fever or respiratory symptoms (32 [64%]), but 3 patients (6%) with only gastrointestinal tract presentations were identified. Obesity (11 [22%]) was the most prevalent comorbidity. Respiratory support was required for 16 patients (32%), including 9 patients (18%) who required mechanical ventilation. One patient (2%) died. None of 14 infants and 1 of 8 immunocompromised patients had severe disease. Obesity was significantly associated with mechanical ventilation in children 2 years or older (6 of 9 [67%] vs 5 of 25 [20%]; P = .03). Lymphopenia was commonly observed at admission (36 [72%]) but did not differ significantly between those with and without severe disease. Those with severe disease had significantly higher C-reactive protein (median, 8.978 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10] vs 0.64 mg/dL) and procalcitonin levels (median, 0.31 ng/mL vs 0.17 ng/mL) at admission (P < .001), as well as elevated peak interleukin 6, ferritin, and D-dimer levels during hospitalization. Hydroxychloroquine was administered to 15 patients (30%) but could not be completed for 3. Prolonged test positivity (maximum of 27 days) was observed in 4 patients (8%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series study of children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19, the disease had diverse manifestations. Infants and immunocompromised patients were not at increased risk of severe disease. Obesity was significantly associated with disease severity.

682,32491091,"OBJECTIVE To estimate the proportion and total number of the general adult population who may be at higher risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil. METHODS We included 51,770 participants from a nationally representative, household-based health survey (PNS) conducted in Brazil. We estimated the proportion and number of adults (>/= 18 years) at risk of severe Covid-19 by sex, educational level, race/ethnicity, and state based on the presence of one or more of the following risk factors: age >/= 65 years or medical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, stroke, chronic kidney disease and moderate to severe asthma, smoking status, and obesity. RESULTS Adults at risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil varied from 34.0% (53 million) to 54.5% (86 million) nationwide. Less-educated adults present a 2-fold higher prevalence of risk factors compared to university graduated. We found no differences by sex and race/ethnicity. Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul were the most vulnerable states in absolute and relative terms of adults at risk. CONCLUSIONS Proportion and total number of adults at risk of severe Covid-19 are high in Brazil, with wide variation across states and adult subgroups. These findings should be considered while designing and implementing prevention measures in Brazil. We argue that these results support broad social isolation measures, particularly when testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 is limited.","OBJECTIVE To estimate the proportion and total number of the general adult population who may be at higher risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil.

686,32470948,"The severity and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) largely depends on a patient's age. Adults over 65 years of age represent 80% of hospitalizations and have a 23-fold greater risk of death than those under 65. In the clinic, COVID-19 patients most commonly present with fever, cough and dyspnea, and from there the disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung consolidation, cytokine release syndrome, endotheliitis, coagulopathy, multiple organ failure and death. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity increase the chances of fatal disease, but they alone do not explain why age is an independent risk factor. Here, we present the molecular differences between young, middle-aged and older people that may explain why COVID-19 is a mild illness in some but life-threatening in others. We also discuss several biological age clocks that could be used in conjunction with genetic tests to identify both the mechanisms of the disease and individuals most at risk. Finally, based on these mechanisms, we discuss treatments that could increase the survival of older people, not simply by inhibiting the virus, but by restoring patients' ability to clear the infection and effectively regulate immune responses.","The severity and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) largely depends on a patient's age.

Given the high prevalence of obesity in the United States, we hypothesized that the presence of obesity may play a role in the clinical course of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of adult patients admitted with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and clinical outcomes were abstracted. BMI (kilograms per meter squared) was analyzed with regard to a composite outcome of intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death and intubation rate. RESULTS: About 770 patients were included (61% male, mean age 63.5 years). Patients with obesity were more likely to present with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Obesity was also associated with a significantly higher rate of ICU admission or death (RR = 1.58, P = 0.002) even after adjusting for age, race, and troponin level. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with obesity had an increased risk for critical illness leading to ICU admission or death compared with normal weight individuals. This study confirms that obesity is a major risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity, significantly impacting disease presentation and critical care requirements.","OBJECTIVE: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has triggered a rapidly expanding global pandemic in which patients exhibit a wide spectrum of disease severity.

689,32459524,"Recent reports have shown a strong association between obesity and the severity of COVID-19 infection, even in the absence of other comorbidities. After infecting the host cells, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may cause a hyperinflammatory reaction through the excessive release of cytokines, a condition known as ""cytokine storm,"" while inducing lymphopenia and a disrupted immune response. Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and immune dysregulation, but the exact mechanisms through which it exacerbates COVID-19 infection are not fully clarified. The production of increased amounts of cytokines such as TNFalpha, IL-1, IL-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) lead to oxidative stress and defective function of innate and adaptive immunity, whereas the activation of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome seems to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the infection. Endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness could favor the recently discovered infection of the endothelium by SARS-CoV-2, whereas alterations in cardiac structure and function and the prothrombotic microenvironment in obesity could provide a link for the increased cardiovascular events in these patients. The successful use of anti-inflammatory agents such as IL-1 and IL-6 blockers in similar hyperinflammatory settings, like that of rheumatoid arthritis, has triggered the discussion of whether such agents could be administrated in selected patients with COVID-19 disease.","Recent reports have shown a strong association between obesity and the severity of COVID-19 infection, even in the absence of other comorbidities.

INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Obesity was the most frequent comorbidity exhibited by coronavirus disease 2019 patients (n = 32, 73% vs n = 11, 28% in controls; p < 0.001). Despite the same severity of illness and level of hypoxemia at admission, coronavirus disease 2019 patients failed more high flow oxygen via nasal cannula challenges (n = 16, 100% vs n = 5, 45% in controls; p = 0.002), were more often intubated (n = 44, 100% vs n = 22, 56% in controls; p < 0.001) and paralyzed (n = 34, 77% vs n = 3, 14% in controls; p < 0.001), required higher level of positive end-expiratory pressure (15 vs 8 cm H2O in controls; p < 0.001), more prone positioning (n = 33, 75% vs n = 6, 27% in controls; p < 0.001), more dialysis (n = 16, 36% vs n = 3, 8% in controls; p = 0.003), more hemodynamic support by vasopressors (n = 36, 82% vs n = 22, 56% in controls; p = 0.001), and had more often a prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation (n = 28, 64% vs n = 10, 26% in controls; p < 0.01) resulting in a more frequent resort to tracheostomy (n = 18, 40.9% vs n = 2, 9% in controls; p = 0.01). However, an intensive management requiring more staff per patient for positioning coronavirus disease 2019 subjects (6 [5-7] vs 5 [4-5] in controls; p < 0.001) yielded the same ICU survival rate in the two groups (n = 34, 77% vs n = 29, 74% in controls; p = 0.23).

694,32447101,"Diabetes mellitus is challenging in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients. As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection. This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly China and the US. Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance. Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits. While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, but whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown. In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified. Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection. Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.","Diabetes mellitus is challenging in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

697,32438328,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic due to droplet infection of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Due to its rapid transmission and high case-fatality rate, recognition of its risk and prognostic factor is important. Obesity has been associated with impaired immune system, increasing the susceptibility for 2019-nCoV infection. We aimed to study the impact of obesity to the prognosis and disease severity of COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search and handsearching was conducted in four databases: Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed. The identified articles were screened using the chosen eligibility criteria. We obtained three retrospective cohort studies (Wu J et al., Lighter J et al., and Simonnet A et al.) to be critically appraised using Newcastle Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: The findings of all included studies were consistent in stating the contribution of obesity as a risk factor to increase the requirement for advanced medical care. Study with the highest quality, Simonnet A et al., reported an increase need of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with body mass index higher than 35 kg/m(2), OR: 7.36 (1.63-33.14; p = 0.021). This is associated with a higher mortality rate in obese population infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Obesity is an independent risk and prognostic factor for the disease severity and the requirement of advanced medical care in COVID-19. This systematic review highlights a particularly vulnerable group - obese, and emphasises on the importance of treatment aggression and disease prevention in this population group.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic due to droplet infection of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

698,32421292,"The goal of this column is to help mental health care professionals understand coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so that they can better explain the complexities of the current crisis to their patients. The bottom-line of this column is that, while COVID-19 can infect virtually everyone in the human population, only about 5% are susceptible to severe infection requiring admission to an intensive care unit and/or causing a fatal outcome and this population can be identified on the basis of comorbid medical illness and/or age. These numbers are based on experience in China, the United States, and Europe. Table 1 presents an analysis conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is further supported by several other sources reviewed in the article. The population at risk for severe infection are individuals with comorbid medical illness and those 85 years of age and older. The comorbid medical illnesses identified as risk factors are preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised status, morbid obesity (ie, body mass index >/=40), diabetes mellitus, and possibly significant kidney or liver impairment. Parenthetically, news reports and the literature sometimes cite age 60 years and older as a risk factor but age between 60 and 85 years is likely a surrogate for having 1 or more of these comorbid medical conditions. While 5% may initially seem like a small number, it nevertheless potentially represents 16.5 million people, given the United States population of 330 million. That is a tremendous number of people requiring intensive care unit admission and/or potentially dying, and individuals in this population have overwhelmed the US health care system in some hotspots. For this reason, this column suggests taking this at-risk population into account in mitigation strategies when attempting to open the US economy. The column addresses the following questions: (1) What are the 3 aspects of the race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19? (2) What data are currently available to help guide decisions to be made? (3) What strategies have been employed to date and how successful have they been? and (4) Might risk stratification of exposure be a viable strategy to minimize the damage caused by the virus? The race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19 requires that we obtain knowledge about the disease and its treatment or prevention, how to best safeguard public health and avoid overwhelming the health care system, and how to minimize the societal damage caused by substantial disruption of the economy. Data gathered over the past 4 months since the COVID-19 virus emerged as a human pathogen have provided guidance for our decisions going forward. The most widely adopted strategies for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic to date have involved the epidemiological approach of encouraging good hygiene practices and social distancing, including orders to ""shelter in place,"" quarantine of high-risk individuals, and isolation of infected individuals. The goal of this epidemiological approach has been to ""flatten the curve"" by reducing the height of the peak of the infection to avoid overwhelming the health care system and society in general, while buying time to learn more about the disease and find more effective ways to deal with it. However, now that more is known about COVID-19 and the portion of the population that is most at risk for serious adverse outcomes including death, it may be possible to move from a shelter-in-place approach for the entire population to focus on those at most risk and thus facilitate a gradual and rational phased reduction of social restrictions to reopen the economy. Such a graduated opening would be based on regions of countries meeting specific criteria in terms of being able to contain the virus, coupled with vigorous monitoring to look for outbreaks, followed by case monitoring, isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of exposed individuals, and increased use of testing for active disease as well as for immunity. Taking the data on high-risk individuals into account would allow for a gradual lifting of restrictions on the majority of the population while maintaining more stringent safeguards to protect the vulnerable portion of the population. Nevertheless, the entire population would need to continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing while simultaneously-and perhaps even more vigorously-focusing on sheltering the vulnerable population until adequate community immunity has been achieved to prevent the spread of the virus, whether that is accomplished through natural exposure alone or with the addition of safe and effective vaccine(s) which may not be available for a year. Continued widespread testing for antibodies will help determine how far or close this country is-and other countries are-from developing effective community immunity.","The goal of this column is to help mental health care professionals understand coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so that they can better explain the complexities of the current crisis to their patients.

701,32410003,"The world is facing Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is causing a large number of deaths and burden on intensive care facilities. It is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China. It has been seen that fewer children contract COVID-19 and among infected, children have less severe disease. Insights in pathophysiological mechanisms of less severity in children could be important for devising therapeutics for high-risk adults and elderly. Early closing of schools and day-care centers led to less frequent exposure and hence, lower infection rate in children. The expression of primary target receptor for SARS-CoV-2, i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), decreases with age. ACE-2 has lung protective effects by limiting angiotensin-2 mediated pulmonary capillary leak and inflammation. Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with high and persistent viral loads in adults. Children have strong innate immune response due to trained immunity (secondary to live-vaccines and frequent viral infections), leading to probably early control of infection at the site of entry. Adult patients show suppressed adaptive immunity and dysfunctional over-active innate immune response in severe infections, which is not seen in children. These could be related to immune-senescence in elderly. Excellent regeneration capacity of pediatric alveolar epithelium may be contributing to early recovery from COVID-19. Children, less frequently, have risk factors such as co-morbidities, smoking, and obesity.

Risk stratification based on the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS), which classifies obesity based on the presence of medical, mental, and/or functional complications rather than on body mass index (BMI), has been shown to be a better predictor of all-cause mortality and it may well be that EOSS stages may better describe the risk of hyperinflammation in patients with COVID-19 infection. Analyzing a group of metabolic ill patients with obesity (EOSS 2 and 3), we found an increased interleukin-6 and linear regression analysis showed a positive correlation with C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.014) and waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR) (p = 0.031). Physicians should be aware of these findings in patients with COVID-19 infection. Early identification of possible hyperinflammation could be fundamental and should guide decision making regarding hospitalization, early respiratory support, and therapy with immunosuppression to improve mortality.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a particular risk to people living with preexisting conditions that impair immune response or amplify pro-inflammatory response.

703,32409502,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with obesity are at increased risk of exacerbations from viral respiratory infections. However, the association of obesity with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. We examined this association using data from the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 383 consecutively hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admitted from 11 January 2020 to 16 February 2020 and followed until 26 March 2020 at the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen were included. Underweight was defined as a BMI <18.5 kg/m(2), normal weight as 18.5-23.9 kg/m(2), overweight as 24.0-27.9 kg/m(2), and obesity as >/=28 kg/m(2). RESULTS: Of the 383 patients, 53.1% were normal weight, 4.2% were underweight, 32.0% were overweight, and 10.7% were obese at admission. Obese patients tended to have symptoms of cough (P = 0.03) and fever (P = 0.06) compared with patients who were not obese. Compared with normal weight patients, those who were overweight had 1.84-fold odds of developing severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95% CI 0.99-3.43, P = 0.05), while those who were obese were at 3.40-fold odds of developing severe disease (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.40-2.86, P = 0.007), after adjusting for age, sex, epidemiological characteristics, days from disease onset to hospitalization, presence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and cancer, and drug used for treatment. Additionally, after similar adjustment, men who were obese versus those who were normal weight were at increased odds of developing severe COVID-19 (OR 5.66, 95% CI 1.80-17.75, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, obese patients had increased odds of progressing to severe COVID-19. As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may continue to spread worldwide, clinicians should pay close attention to obese patients, who should be carefully managed with prompt and aggressive treatment.","OBJECTIVE: Patients with obesity are at increased risk of exacerbations from viral respiratory infections.

Purpose To analyze the prognostic value of a chest radiograph severity scoring system for younger (nonelderly) patients with COVID-19 at initial presentation to the emergency department (ED); outcomes of interest included hospitalization, intubation, prolonged stay, sepsis, and death. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients between the ages of 21 and 50 years who presented to the ED of an urban multicenter health system from March 10 to March 26, 2020, with COVID-19 confirmation on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were identified. Each patient's ED chest radiograph was divided into six zones and examined for opacities by two cardiothoracic radiologists, and scores were collated into a total concordant lung zone severity score. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between clinical parameters, chest radiograph scores, and patient outcomes. Results The study included 338 patients: 210 men (62%), with median age of 39 years (interquartile range, 31-45 years). After adjustment for demographics and comorbidities, independent predictors of hospital admission (n = 145, 43%) were chest radiograph severity score of 2 or more (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.5, 11; P < .001) and obesity (odds ratio, 2.4 [95% CI: 1.1, 5.4] or morbid obesity). Among patients who were admitted, a chest radiograph score of 3 or more was an independent predictor of intubation (n = 28) (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI: 1.8, 13; P = .002) as was hospital site. No significant difference was found in primary outcomes across race and ethnicity or those with a history of tobacco use, asthma, or diabetes mellitus type II.

707,32386567,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is wreaking havoc on society, especially health-care systems, including disrupting bariatric and metabolic surgery. The current limitations on accessibility to non-urgent care undermine postoperative monitoring of patients who have undergone such operations. Furthermore, like most elective surgery, new bariatric and metabolic procedures are being postponed worldwide during the pandemic. When the outbreak abates, a backlog of people seeking these operations will exist. Hence, surgical candidates face prolonged delays of beneficial treatment. Because of the progressive nature of obesity and diabetes, delaying surgery increases risks for morbidity and mortality, thus requiring strategies to mitigate harm. The risk of harm, however, varies among patients, depending on the type and severity of their comorbidities. A triaging strategy is therefore needed. The traditional weight-centric patient-selection criteria do not favour cases based on actual clinical needs. In this Personal View, experts from the Diabetes Surgery Summit consensus conference series provide guidance for the management of patients while surgery is delayed and for postoperative surveillance.

710,32361738,"BACKGROUND: With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. Data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into 3 disease severity groups (nonsevere, severe, and critical), based on initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify risk factors associated with clinical outcomes, and log-rank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. RESULTS: Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement in patient outcomes. By univariate logistic regression analysis, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Multivariate regression indicated age >65 years (P < .001), smoking (P = .001), critical disease status (P = .002), diabetes (P = .025), high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg/mL, P = .02), leukocytosis (>10 x 109/L, P < .001), and neutrophilia (>75 x 109/L, P < .001) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. In contrast, the administration of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes (P < .001), which was confirmed by survival analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Hypnotics may be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19.","BACKGROUND: With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic.

713,32352637,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the potential association of obesity and other chronic diseases with severe outcomes, such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This study analyzed a retrospective cohort of 103 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Demographic data, past medical history, and hospital course were collected and analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to examine associations. RESULTS: From February 17 to April 5, 103 consecutive patients were hospitalized with COVID-19. Among them, 44 patients (42.7%) were admitted to the ICU, and 29 (65.9%) required IMV. The prevalence of obesity was 47.5% (49 of 103). In a multivariate analysis, severe obesity (BMI >/= 35 kg/m(2) ) was associated with ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.39, 95% CI: 1.13-25.64). Moreover, patients who required IMV were more likely to have had heart disease (aOR: 3.41, 95% CI: 1.05-11.06), obesity (BMI = 30-34.9 kg/m(2) ; aOR: 6.85, 95% CI: 1.05-44.82), or severe obesity (BMI >/= 35 kg/m(2) ; aOR: 9.99, 95% CI: 1.39-71.69). CONCLUSIONS: In our analysis, severe obesity (BMI >/= 35 kg/m(2) ) was associated with ICU admission, whereas history of heart disease and obesity (BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2) ) were independently associated with the use of IMV.

715,32339391,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), demonstrates high morbidity and mortality caused by development of a severe acute respiratory syndrome connected with extensive pulmonary fibrosis. In this Perspective, we argue that adipocytes and adipocyte-like cells, such as pulmonary lipofibroblasts, may play an important role in the pathogenic response to SARS-CoV-2. Expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (the functional receptor for SARS-CoV) is upregulated in adipocytes of patients with obesity and diabetes, which turns adipose tissue into a potential target and viral reservoir. This may explain why obesity and diabetes are potential comorbidities for COVID-19 infections. Similar to the recently established adipocyte-myofibroblast transition, pulmonary lipofibroblasts located in the alveolar interstitium and closely related to classical adipocytes demonstrate the ability to transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts that play an integral part of pulmonary fibrosis. This may significantly increase the severity of the local response to SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. To reduce the severity and mortality associated with COVID-19, we propose to probe for the clinical response to thiazolidinediones, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma agonists that are well-known antidiabetic drugs. Thiazolidinediones are able to stabilize lipofibroblasts in their ""inactive"" state, preventing the transition to myofibroblasts and thereby reducing the development of pulmonary fibrosis and stimulating its resolution.","Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), demonstrates high morbidity and mortality caused by development of a severe acute respiratory syndrome connected with extensive pulmonary fibrosis.

718,32305831,"INTRODUCTION: Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, it is known that the severe course of the disease occurs mostly among the elderly, whereas it is rare among children and young adults. Comorbidities, in particular, diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke, are strongly associated with the need for intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Thus, there is concern that children treated for cancer may allso be at risk for an unfavourable course of infection. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China, mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukaemia. AIM AND METHODS: We made a flash survey on COVID-19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short Web-based survey. RESULTS: We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed up. At the time of the survey, more than 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease, and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken and treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Thus, even children receiving anticancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than that observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.","INTRODUCTION: Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, it is known that the severe course of the disease occurs mostly among the elderly, whereas it is rare among children and young adults.

722,32271993,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide, notably in Europe and North America where obesity is highly prevalent. The relation between obesity and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been fully documented. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the relationship between clinical characteristics, including BMI, and the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in 124 consecutive patients admitted in intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 in a single French center. RESULTS: Obesity (BMI > 30) and severe obesity (BMI > 35) were present in 47.6% and 28.2% of cases, respectively. Overall, 85 patients (68.6%) required IMV. The proportion of patients who required IMV increased with BMI categories (P < 0.01, chi(2) test for trend), and it was greatest in patients with BMI > 35 (85.7%). In multivariate logistic regression, the need for IMV was significantly associated with male sex (P < 0.05) and BMI (P < 0.05), independent of age, diabetes, and hypertension. The odds ratio for IMV in patients with BMI > 35 versus patients with BMI < 25 was 7.36 (1.63-33.14; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed a high frequency of obesity among patients admitted in intensive care for SARS-CoV-2. Disease severity increased with BMI. Obesity is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 severity, requiring increased attention to preventive measures in susceptible individuals.","OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly spreading worldwide, notably in Europe and North America where obesity is highly prevalent.

In multivariate logistic regression, the need for IMV was significantly associated with male sex (P < 0.05) and BMI (P < 0.05), independent of age, diabetes, and hypertension. The odds ratio for IMV in patients with BMI > 35 versus patients with BMI < 25 was 7.36 (1.63-33.14; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed a high frequency of obesity among patients admitted in intensive care for SARS-CoV-2. Disease severity increased with BMI. Obesity is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 severity, requiring increased attention to preventive measures in susceptible individuals.",Simonnet A, H,Journal Article," OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly<br>spreading worldwide, notably in Europe and North America<br>where obesity is highly prevalent.

723,32249357,"AIMS: Analyze the relationship between obesity and influenza. METHODS: Basal hormone milieu, defective response of both innate and adaptive immune system and sedentariness are major determinants in the severity of influenza viral infection in obese patients. Being overweight not only increases the risk of infection and of complications for the single obese person, but a large prevalence of obese individuals within the population might increase the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout the total population and eventually might increase overall mortality rate of an influenza pandemic. RESULTS: Waiting for the development of a vaccination against COVID-19, isolation of positive cases and social distancing are the primary interventions. Nonetheless, evidence from previous influenza pandemics suggests the following interventions aimed at improving immune response: (1) lose weight with a mild caloric restriction; (2) include AMPK activators and PPAR gamma activators in the drug treatment for obesity associated with diabetes; and (3) practice mild-to-moderate physical exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Due to prolonged viral shedding, quarantine in obese subjects should likely be longer than normal weight individuals.","AIMS: Analyze the relationship between obesity and influenza.

725,34695341,"Historically, viral respiratory infections in pregnant women have shown an increase in the risk of morbidity and mortality. With regards to COVID-19, information is limited and a greater risk of severe morbidity or mortality has not been shown, when compared to general population; however, pregnant women with comorbidities such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension have shown a greater severity of the disease, consistent with the general population with these comorbidities. The risk of vertical transmission appears to be low: it has not been demonstrated in any case during the current outbreak of COVID-19 in China, nor in previous epidemics of similar coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). Existing studies have not demonstrated the presence of the virus in genital fluid, amniotic fluid or maternal milk. Described cases of infection in newborns probably come from horizontal transmission, which suggests breastfeeding with respiratory hygiene measures. Given that COVID-19 is a new disease that has extended around the world and that current knowledge is still insufficient, it is mandatory the continued accumulation of data to discover in depth the action mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the disease, and constant update of means of prevention and handling of the disease.","Historically, viral respiratory infections in pregnant women have shown an increase in the risk of morbidity and mortality.
