0,35502514,"INTRODUCTION: It is not clear whether asthma, the most frequent chronic disease in childhood, is a risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pediatric population and how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the lung functions in these patients. PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the course and the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection among children with asthma and determine the risk factors for the decline in lung function tests METHODS: In this retrospective study, asthmatic children with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were compared with a random control group of asthmatic patients without COVID-19. In addition, the clinical course and the effect on lung function tests of COVID-19 among children with asthma were also evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine patients who had COVID-19, and 792 who did not were included in the study. Fever, fatigue, and cough were the most frequent symptoms during COVID-19. Regarding the severity of COVID-19, 163 patients (87.6%) had a mild clinical condition, 13 (7%) had moderate disease, one (0.5%) had severe disease and two had (1.1%) critically ill disease. Two patients were diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), one patient suffered from pneumothorax. Lung function tests of the patients before and after COVID-19 infection were analyzed; no significant differences were found in FEV1 % (91.7% vs 90.9%, p=0.513), FVC% (89.8% vs 90.8%, p=0.502) and FEV1/FVC (103.1% vs 100.6%, p=0.056), while FEF25-75% values (107.6% vs 98.4%, p<0.001) were significantly lower after the COVID-19 infection. Obesity [OR: 3.785, 95%CI: 1.152-12.429, P =0.028] and having a family history of atopy [OR:3.359, 95%CI:1.168-9.657, P = 0.025] were found to be the independent risk factors for >/=25% decrease in FEF25-75 after COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection leads to dysfunction of the small airways in asthmatic children and obesity is an independent risk factor for >/=25% decrease in FEF25-75. The long-term effects of COVID-19 infection especially on small airways require close monitoring in children with asthma. This article is protected by copyright.

1,35501222,"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. Till now, it affected 452.4 million (Spain, 11.18 million) persons all over the world with a total of 6.04 million of deaths (Spain, 100,992). It is observed that 75% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have at least one COVID-19 associated comorbidity. It was shown that people with underlying chronic illnesses are more likely to get it and grow seriously ill. Individuals with COVID-19 who have a past medical history of cardiovascular disorder, cancer, obesity, chronic lung disease, diabetes, or neurological disease had the worst prognosis and are more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome or pneumonia. COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system in a variety of ways and across a spectrum of levels of disease severity, depending on a person's immune system, age and comorbidities. Symptoms can range from mild, such as cough, shortness of breath and fever, to critical disease, including respiratory failure, shock and multi-organ system failure. So, COVID-19 infection can cause overall worsening of these previous respiratory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, etc. This review aims to provide information on the impact of the COVID-19 disease on pre-existing lung comorbidities.","On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic.

2,35442470,"OBJECTIVE: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, emergency department utilization and hospitalization rates for allergic diseases declined and the severity of allergies among admitted patients was low. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of allergic diseases among adolescents and the changes in trend during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with those during the preceding 11 years. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from the nationwide web-based self-report Korea Youth Risk Behavior Survey. From 2009 to 2020, adolescents aged 13-18 years participated in the survey. The survey period was divided into pre-pandemic Periods I (2009-2011), II (2012-2014), III (2015-2017), and IV (2018-2019) and the pandemic period (Period V, 2020). The current prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, allergic morbidity (having at least one of the three conditions) and changes in the prevalence before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were analyzed. RESULTS: Data of 787,043 participants were analyzed after weighting the study population (mean age, 15.1 years; males, 52.3%). The prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic morbidity was 2.1%, 18.4%, 6.8%, and 23.6%, respectively. The prevalence of allergic morbidity increased between Periods I and IV but declined significantly from Periods IV to V. From Periods I to IV, the prevalence of asthma decreased, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis increased, and the prevalence of atopic dermatitis remained unchanged. During Period V, the prevalence of all three conditions decreased. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to update management measures and develop relevant policies in response to the altered prevalence of allergic diseases since the outbreak of COVID-19.","OBJECTIVE: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, emergency department utilization and hospitalization rates for allergic diseases declined and the severity of allergies among admitted patients was low.

Objective: To determine if temporary androgen suppression induced by degarelix improves clinical outcomes of inpatients hospitalized with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Hormonal Intervention for the Treatment in Veterans With COVID-19 Requiring Hospitalization (HITCH) phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial compared efficacy of degarelix plus standard care vs placebo plus standard care on clinical outcomes in men hospitalized with COVID-19 but not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Inpatients were enrolled at 14 Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals from July 22, 2020, to April 8, 2021. Data were analyzed from August 9 to October 15, 2021. Interventions: Patients stratified by age, history of hypertension, and disease severity were centrally randomized 2:1 to degarelix, (1-time subcutaneous dose of 240 mg) or a saline placebo. Standard care included but was not limited to supplemental oxygen, antibiotics, vasopressor support, peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis, intravenous fluids, remdesivir, convalescent plasma, and dexamethasone. Main Outcomes and Measures: The composite primary end point was mortality, ongoing need for hospitalization, or requirement for mechanical ventilation at day 15 after randomization. Secondary end points were time to clinical improvement, inpatient mortality, length of hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation, time to achieve a temperature within reference range, maximum severity of COVID-19, and the composite end point at 30 days. Results: The trial was stopped for futility after the planned interim analysis, at which time there were 96 evaluable patients, including 62 patients randomized to the degarelix group and 34 patients in the placebo group, out of 198 initially planned. The median (range) age was 70.5 (48-85) years. Common comorbidities included chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (15 patients [15.6%]), hypertension (75 patients [78.1%]), cardiovascular disease (27 patients [28.1%]), asthma (12 patients [12.5%]), diabetes (49 patients [51.0%]), and chronic respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen at baseline prior to COVID-19 (9 patients [9.4%]). For the primary end point, there was no significant difference between the degarelix and placebo groups (19 patients [30.6%] vs 9 patients [26.5%]; P = .67). Similarly, no differences were observed between degarelix and placebo groups in any secondary end points, including inpatient mortality (11 patients [17.7%] vs 6 patients [17.6%]) or all-cause mortality (11 patients [17.7%] vs 7 patents [20.6%]). There were no differences between degarelix and placebo groups in the overall rates of adverse events (13 patients [21.0%] vs 8 patients [23.5%) and serious adverse events (19 patients [30.6%] vs 13 patients [32.4%]), nor unexpected safety concerns.

4,35342017,"BACKGROUND: Several chronic conditions have been associated with a higher risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including asthma. However, there are conflicting conclusions regarding risk of severe disease in this population. OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of asthma on COVID-19 outcomes in a cohort of hospitalized patients and whether there is any association between asthma severity and worse outcomes. METHODS: We identified hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with confirmatory polymerase chain reaction testing with (n = 183) and without asthma (n = 1319) using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes between March 1 and December 30, 2020. We determined asthma maintenance medications, pulmonary function tests, highest historical absolute eosinophil count, and immunoglobulin E. Primary outcomes included death, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and ICU and hospital length of stay. Analysis was adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, smoking status, and timing of illness in the pandemic. RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, we found no difference in our primary outcomes between patients with asthma and patients without asthma. However, in adjusted analyses, patients with asthma were more likely to have mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.44; P = .04), ICU admission (odds ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.09-2.29; P = .02), longer hospital length of stay (risk ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.09-1.55; P < .003), and higher mortality (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.01-2.33; P = .04) compared with the non-asthma cohort. Inhaled corticosteroid use and eosinophilic phenotype were not associated with considerabledifferences.

5,35341398,"Background: A higher risk for COVID-19 infection and severity for men compared to women has been described since the beginning of the pandemic. The role of androgens has been recently highlighted as they control two key steps of coronavirus infection mediated through the transmembrane protease serin 2 (TMPRRS2) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the lung tissue. Furthermore, a high incidence of androgenic alopecia among males with COVID-19 disease have been reported.Objective: This study aims to evaluate the telogen effluvium (TE) prevalence and its relationship with clinical and immunologic parameters in a sample of patients consecutively evaluated after recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia in Northern Italy.Methods: Overall 104 patients were recruited within three months from COVID-19 pneumonia recovery; 80 (77%) had been hospitalized in a Respiratory Intensive Care Unit and the remaining ones had been treated at home. The extent of TE was assessed with a visual analogic scale for thick bundle of hairs. Demographic and clinical data and systemic inflammation biomarkers were also evaluated.Results. Thirty-two patients reported a history of TE and their mean TE-VAS score was 5.78 +/- 1.72 (range 3-9). Women had about a 5-fold higher risk (odds) of complaining of TE compared to males (OR = 4.69, 95%CI: 1.91, 11.49; p = .001), and the association became stronger when adjusted for COVID-19 severity (hospital admission vs home care: OR = 6.09, 95%CI: 2.34, 15.88; p < .001). Levels of C-reactive protein >1.90 mg/l (ORadj: 2.43, 95%CI 0.85, 7.05, p = 0.096) or IL 1beta > 5 ng/l (ORadj 4.72, 95%CI: 1.31, 23.19, p = .03) were also significantly associated with TE.Conclusion: This exploratory study raises the hypothesis that hair shedding is more strictly related to the severity of COVID-19 disease and the underlying inflammation rather than to patients' hormonal status. KEY MESSAGESThe presence of Telogen effluvium (TE) was significantly more common in women.Higher severity of the Covid-19 disease seems to play a critical role, more important than the hormonal influence, in the development of TE.The severity of inflammation related to TE and Covid-19 could also play a role as suggested by the higher levels of CRP and platelets and IL1beta.","Background: A higher risk for COVID-19 infection and severity for men compared to women has been described since the beginning of the pandemic. The role of androgens has been recently highlighted as they control two key steps of coronavirus infection mediated through the transmembrane protease serin 2 (TMPRRS2) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the lung tissue. Furthermore, a high incidence of androgenic alopecia among males with COVID-19 disease have been reported.Objective: This study aims to evaluate the telogen effluvium (TE) prevalence and its relationship with clinical and immunologic parameters in a sample of patients consecutively evaluated after recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia in Northern Italy.Methods: Overall 104 patients were recruited within three months from COVID-19 pneumonia recovery; 80 (77%) had been hospitalized in a Respiratory Intensive Care Unit and the remaining ones had been treated at home. The extent of TE was assessed with a visual analogic scale for thick bundle of hairs. Demographic and clinical data and systemic inflammation biomarkers were also evaluated.Results. Thirty-two patients reported a history of TE and their mean TE-VAS score was 5.78 +/- 1.72 (range 3-9). Women had about a 5-fold higher risk (odds) of complaining of TE compared to males (OR = 4.69, 95%CI: 1.91, 11.49; p = .001), and the association became stronger when adjusted for COVID-19 severity (hospital admission vs home care: OR = 6.09, 95%CI: 2.34, 15.88; p < .001).

6,35338811,"INTRODUCTION: The current evidence indicates that the severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is lower in the pediatric population but local data are still limited. Objective: To characterize the clinical and epidemiological aspects of COVID-19 infection in patients younger than 18 years in Argentina. POPULATION AND METHODS: Cross-sectional, observational, and analytical study of confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 0-18 years seen between March 2020 and March 2021 at 19 referral children's hospitals of Argentina. A multivariate analysis was done to identify predictors of severe cases. RESULTS: A total of 2690 COVID-19 cases were included: 77.7% lived in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires; 50.1% were males; patients' median age was 5.6 years. Of them, 90% were seen during epidemiological weeks 20-47 of 2020; 60.4% had a history of contact with COVID-19 patients; and 96.6% in their family setting. Also, 51.4% had respiratory symptoms; 61.6%, general symptoms; 18.8%, gastrointestinal symptoms; 17.1%, neurological symptoms; 7.2%, other symptoms; and 21.5% were asymptomatic. In addition, 59.4% of patients were hospitalized and 7.4% had a severe or critical course. A total of 57 patients developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome. A history of asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease, moderate to severe malnutrition, obesity, chronic neurological disease and/or age younger than 6 months were independent predictors of severity.

7,35308674,"Background In this study, we aimed to compare two outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Belgium in tomographic and biological-clinical aspects with artificial intelligence (AI). Methodology We performed an observational retrospective study. Adult patients who were symptomatic in the first seven days with COVID-19 infection, diagnosed by chest computed tomography (CT) and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, were included in this study. The first wave of the pandemic lasted from March 25, 2020, to May 25, 2020, and the second wave lasted from October 7, 2020, to December 7, 2020. For each wave, two subgroups were defined depending on whether respiratory failure occurred during the course of the disease. The quantitative estimation of COVID-19 lung lesions was performed by AI, radiologists, and radiology residents. The chest CT severity score was calculated by AI. Results In the 202 patients included in this study, we found statistically significant differences for obesity, hypertension, and asthma. The differences were predominant in the second wave. Moreover, a mixed distribution (central and peripherical) of pulmonary lesions was noted in the second wave, but no differences were noted regarding mortality, respiratory failure, complications, and other radiological and biological elements. Chest CT severity score was among the risk factors of mortality and respiratory failure. There was a mild agreement between AI and visual evaluation of pulmonary lesion extension (K = 0.4). Conclusions Between March and December 2020, in our cohort, for the majority of the parameters analyzed, we did not record significant changes between the two waves. AI can reduce the experience and performance gap of radiologists and better establish a hospitalization criterion.","Background In this study, we aimed to compare two outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Belgium in tomographic and biological-clinical aspects with artificial intelligence (AI).

8,35262185,"BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids are well established for the long-term treatment of inflammatory respiratory diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They have been investigated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The anti-inflammatory action of inhaled corticosteroids might have the potential to reduce the risk of severe illness resulting from hyperinflammation in COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether inhaled corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 7 October 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating inhaled corticosteroids for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, sex, or ethnicity. We included the following interventions: any type or dose of inhaled corticosteroids. We included the following comparison: inhaled corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (with or without placebo). We excluded studies examining nasal or topical steroids. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. For risk of bias assessment, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the outcomes of mortality, admission to hospital or death, symptom resolution, time to symptom resolution, serious adverse events, adverse events, and infections. MAIN RESULTS: Inhaled corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (with/without placebo) - People with a confirmed diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 We found no studies that included people with a confirmed diagnosis of moderate-to-severe COVID-19. - People with a confirmed diagnosis of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or mild COVID-19 We included three RCTs allocating 3607 participants, of whom 2490 had confirmed mild COVID-19. We analysed a subset of the total number of participants recruited to the studies (2171, 52% female) as some trials had a platform design where not all participants were allocated to treatment groups simultaneously. The included studies were community-based, recruiting people who were able to use inhaler devices to deliver steroids and relied on remote assessment and self-reporting of outcomes. Most people were older than 50 years and had co-morbidities such as hypertension, lung disease, or diabetes. The studies were conducted in high-income countries prior to wide-scale vaccination programmes. A total of 1057 participants were analysed in the inhaled corticosteroid arm (budesonide: 860 participants; ciclesonide: 197 participants), and 1075 participants in the control arm. No studies included people with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. With respect to the following outcomes, inhaled corticosteroids compared to standard care: - may result in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (at up to day 30) (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 1.67; 2132 participants; low-certainty evidence). In absolute terms, this means that for every nine deaths per 1000 people not receiving inhaled corticosteroids, there were six deaths per 1000 people who did receive the intervention (95% CI 2 to 16 per 1000 people); - probably reduces admission to hospital or death (at up to 30 days) (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.99; 2025 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); - probably increases resolution of all initial symptoms at day 14 (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.30; 1986 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); - may reduce the duration to symptom resolution (at up to day 30) (by -4.00 days, 95% CI -6.22 to -1.78 less than control group rate of 12 days; 139 participants; low-certainty evidence); - the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on serious adverse events (during study period) (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.76; 1586 participants; very low-certainty evidence); - may result in little to no difference in adverse events (at up to day 30) (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.31; 400 participants; low-certainty evidence); - may result in little to no difference in infections (during study period) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.58; 400 participants; low-certainty evidence). As studies did not report outcomes for subgroups (e.g. age, ethnicity, sex), we did not perform subgroup analyses. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In people with confirmed COVID-19 and mild symptoms who are able to use inhaler devices, we found moderate-certainty evidence that inhaled corticosteroids probably reduce the combined endpoint of admission to hospital or death and increase the resolution of all initial symptoms at day 14. Low-certainty evidence suggests that corticosteroids make little to no difference in all-cause mortality up to day 30 and may decrease the duration to symptom resolution. We do not know whether inhaled corticosteroids increase or decrease serious adverse events due to heterogeneity in the way they were reported across the studies. There is low-certainty evidence that inhaled corticosteroids may decrease infections. The evidence we identified came from studies in high-income settings using budesonide and ciclesonide prior to vaccination roll-outs. We identified a lack of evidence concerning quality of life assessments, serious adverse events, and people with asymptomatic infection or with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The 10 ongoing and four completed, unpublished RCTs that we identified in trial registries address similar settings and research questions as in the current body of evidence. We expect to incorporate the findings of these studies in future versions of this review. We monitor newly published results of RCTs on inhaled corticosteroids on a weekly basis and will update the review when the evidence or our certainty in the evidence changes.","BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids are well established for the long-term treatment of inflammatory respiratory diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

9,35247982,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has challenged healthcare globally. An acute increase in the number of hospitalized patients has necessitated a rigorous reorganization of hospital care, thereby creating circumstances that previously have been identified as facilitating prescribing errors (PEs), e.g. a demanding work environment, a high turnover of doctors, and prescribing beyond expertise. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients may be at risk of PEs, potentially resulting in patient harm. We determined the prevalence, severity, and risk factors for PEs in post-COVID-19 patients, hospitalized during the first wave of COVID-19 in the Netherlands, 3 months after discharge. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study recruited patients who visited a post-COVID-19 outpatient clinic of an academic hospital in the Netherlands, 3 months after COVID-19 hospitalization, between June 1 and October 1 2020. All patients with appointments were eligible for inclusion. The prevalence and severity of PEs were assessed in a multidisciplinary consensus meeting. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by univariate and multivariate analysis to identify independent risk factors for PEs. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were included, of whom 92% had >/=1 PE and 8% experienced medication-related harm requiring an immediate change in medication therapy to prevent detoriation. Overall, 68% of all identified PEs were made during or after the COVID-19 related hospitalization. Multivariate analyses identified ICU admission (OR 6.08, 95% CI 2.16-17.09) and a medical history of COPD / asthma (OR 5.36, 95% CI 1.34-21.5) as independent risk factors for PEs. CONCLUSIONS: PEs occurred frequently during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Patients admitted to an ICU during COVID-19 hospitalization or who had a medical history of COPD / asthma were at risk of PEs. These risk factors can be used to identify high-risk patients and to implement targeted interventions. Awareness of prescribing safely is crucial to prevent harm in this new patient population.","BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has challenged healthcare globally. An acute increase in the number of hospitalized patients has necessitated a rigorous reorganization of hospital care, thereby creating circumstances that previously have been identified as facilitating prescribing errors (PEs), e.g. a demanding work environment, a high turnover of doctors, and prescribing beyond expertise. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients may be at risk of PEs, potentially resulting in patient harm. We determined the prevalence, severity, and risk factors for PEs in post-COVID-19 patients, hospitalized during the first wave of COVID-19 in the Netherlands, 3 months after discharge. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study recruited patients who visited a post-COVID-19 outpatient clinic of an academic hospital in the Netherlands, 3 months after COVID-19 hospitalization, between June 1 and October 1 2020. All patients with appointments were eligible for inclusion. The prevalence and severity of PEs were assessed in a multidisciplinary consensus meeting. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by univariate and multivariate analysis to identify independent risk factors for PEs. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were included, of whom 92% had >/=1 PE and 8% experienced medication-related harm requiring an immediate change in medication therapy to prevent detoriation. Overall, 68% of all identified PEs were made during or after the COVID-19 related hospitalization. Multivariate analyses identified ICU admission (OR 6.08, 95% CI 2.16-17.09) and a medical history of COPD / asthma (OR 5.36, 95% CI 1.34-21.5) as independent risk factors for PEs. CONCLUSIONS: PEs occurred frequently during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Patients admitted to an ICU during COVID-19 hospitalization or who had a medical history of COPD / asthma were at risk of PEs. These risk factors can be used to identify high-risk patients and to implement targeted interventions.

10,35233327,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has accounted for over 352 million cases and five million deaths globally. Although it affects populations across all nations, developing or transitional, of all genders and ages, the extent of the specific involvement is not very well known. This study aimed to analyze and determine how different were the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic by assessing computed tomography severity scores (CT-SS). Methodology This was a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study performed at a tertiary care Institution. We included 301 patients who underwent CT of the chest between June and October 2020 and 1,001 patients who underwent CT of the chest between February and April 2021. All included patients were symptomatic and were confirmed to be COVID-19 positive. We compared the CT-SS between the two datasets. In addition, we analyzed the distribution of CT-SS concerning age, comorbidities, and gender, as well as their differences between the two waves of COVID-19. Analysis was performed using the SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The artificial intelligence platform U-net architecture with Xception encoder was used in the analysis. Results The study data revealed that while the mean CT-SS did not differ statistically between the two waves of COVID-19, the age group most affected in the second wave was almost a decade younger. While overall the disease had a predilection toward affecting males, our findings showed that females were more afflicted in the second wave of COVID-19 compared to the first wave. In particular, the disease had an increased severity in cases with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma, and tuberculosis. Conclusions This assessment demonstrated no significant difference in radiological severity score between the two waves of COVID-19. The secondary objective revealed that the two waves showed demographical differences. Hence, we iterate that no demographical subset of the population should be considered low risk as the disease manifestation was heterogeneous.","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has accounted for over 352 million cases and five million deaths globally.

In addition, lung function test and asthma control test (ACT) before and after COVID-19 were analyzed. Data was obtained from electronic medical records from March 2020 to April 2021. RESULTS: Two hundred one asthmatic patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by validated detection test. About 30% of the patients were admitted for bilateral pneumonia. Advanced age, elevated D-dimer, lower numbers of lymphocytes and eosinophils, heart diseases and hypertension were associated with severe COVID-19. Allergic and mixed allergic/eosinophilic phenotype and their biomarkers (total IgE, aeroallergens sensitizations, allergic rhinitis, and blood eosinophilia) were related to fewer hospital admissions. Poor control and lower forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) were related to worse prognosis of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Asthmatic patients with allergic and eosinophilic phenotype have a better evolution of COVID-19 and lower risk of admissions. Older patients, cardiovascular comorbidities, AERD and eosinopenia are related to severity COVID-19.","PURPOSE: The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has had a high impact on patients with chronic diseases.

13,35189888,"BACKGROUND: Prospective population-based studies investigating multiple determinants of pre-vaccination antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are lacking. METHODS: We did a prospective population-based study in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-naive UK adults recruited between May 1 and November 2, 2020, without a positive swab test result for SARS-CoV-2 prior to enrolment. Information on 88 potential sociodemographic, behavioural, nutritional, clinical and pharmacological risk factors was obtained through online questionnaires, and combined IgG/IgA/IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein were determined in dried blood spots obtained between November 6, 2020, and April 18, 2021. We used logistic and linear regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and adjusted geometric mean ratios (aGMRs) for potential determinants of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity (all participants) and antibody titres (seropositive participants only), respectively. RESULTS: Of 11,130 participants, 1696 (15.2%) were seropositive. Factors independently associated with higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity included frontline health/care occupation (aOR 1.86, 95% CI 1.48-2.33), international travel (1.20, 1.07-1.35), number of visits to shops and other indoor public places (>/= 5 vs. 0/week: 1.29, 1.06-1.57, P-trend = 0.01), body mass index (BMI) >/= 25 vs. < 25 kg/m(2) (1.24, 1.11-1.39), South Asian vs. White ethnicity (1.65, 1.10-2.49) and alcohol consumption >/=15 vs. 0 units/week (1.23, 1.04-1.46). Light physical exercise associated with lower risk (0.80, 0.70-0.93, for >/= 10 vs. 0-4 h/week). Among seropositive participants, higher titres of anti-Spike antibodies associated with factors including BMI >/= 30 vs. < 25 kg/m(2) (aGMR 1.10, 1.02-1.19), South Asian vs. White ethnicity (1.22, 1.04-1.44), frontline health/care occupation (1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.39), international travel (1.11, 1.05-1.16) and number of visits to shops and other indoor public places (>/= 5 vs. 0/week: 1.12, 1.02-1.23, P-trend = 0.01); these associations were not substantially attenuated by adjustment for COVID-19 disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Higher alcohol consumption and lower light physical exercise represent new modifiable risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, the active components of YPF and the mechanisms of components affecting COVID-19 are unclear. This study aimed to determine active constituents and elucidate its potential mechanisms. METHODS: Ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF-MS) and liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QQQ-MS) were used to determine the components and absorbable constituents of YPF. Secondly, TCMSP, Drugbank, Swiss and PharmMapper were used to search the targets of absorbable bioactive constituents of YPF, and the targets of COVID-19 were identified based on GeneCards and OMIM databases. STRING database was used to filter the possible inter-protein interactions. Thirdly, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis were performed to identify molecular function and systemic involvement of target genes.

15,35155689,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious global health issue, especially for people with pre-existing health conditions. Patients dealing with asthma are presumed to be at higher risk as COVID-19 may cause severe respiratory distress. MAIN BODY: From the initial stage of the pandemic, several clinical trials and studies have assessed the association between COVID-19 and asthma; however, no significant association was reported. This may be due to the fact that most of the asthma cases remained undiagnosed and overlapping respiratory features make it difficult to differentiate between these two diseases. The pathomechanism of the conditions and the immune response generated in response to the conditions suggest that the presence of any of the conditions is very likely to influence the presence or severity of the other condition. So far, no specific treatments are known for COVID-19; however, the use of plasma therapy and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs during the initial phase of the pandemic and widespread vaccination during the latter phase has given positive outcomes in reducing COVID-19 cases as well as disease severity. SHORT CONCLUSION: Taking asthma as an increased risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity, this article aims to provide comprehensive insights into the risk and proper management of asthma patients during this COVID-19 pandemic. The common medications of asthma patients suppress their respiratory immune response that might facilitate cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. Similarly, there are risks of viral-induced asthma exacerbations. Besides, different social issues such as shortage of medicines, SDOH, and delayed clinical trials put asthma patients through inconvenience. The primary focus at this point should be to reduce probable asthma attacks and severity to prevent hospitalization of asthma patients. Moreover, for better management of asthma patients maintaining an asthma action plan and healthy lifestyle, ensuring a nutritious diet, and developing self-management interventions can play a crucial role.","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious global health issue, especially for people with pre-existing health conditions.

16,35146925,"BACKGROUND: Chronic illnesses were reported to be poor prognostic factors associated with severe illness and mortality in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The association with asthma, however, is limited and controversial, especially for mild asthma. METHODS: A territory wide retrospective study was conducted to investigate the association between asthma and the prognosis of COVID-19. All patients with laboratory confirmed in Hong Kong for COVID-19 from the 23 January to 30 September 2020 were included in the study. Severe diseases were defined as those who develop respiratory complications, systemic complications, and death. RESULTS: Among the 4498 patients included in the analysis, 165 had asthma, with 141 having mild asthma. Patients with asthma were significantly more likely to require invasive mechanical ventilation (incidence = 17.0% odds ratio [OR] = 4.765, p < 0.001), oxygen therapy (incidence = 39.4%, OR = 3.291, p < 0.001), intensive care unit admission (incidence = 21.2%, OR = 3.625, p < 0.001), and systemic steroid treatment (incidence = 34.5%, OR = 4.178, p < 0.001) and develop shock (incidence = 16.4%, OR = 4.061, p < 0.001), acute kidney injury (incidence = 6.1%, OR = 3.281, p = 0.033), and secondary bacterial infection (incidence = 56.4%, OR = 2.256, p < 0.001).

17,35132841,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the most important global issue since December 2019. Although the clinical course of COVID-19 is known to be milder in children than in adults, associated hospitalizations among children have increased since the emergence of contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and the achievement of a high vaccination rate in adults. Considering these global and domestic situations, we believe that risk stratification in children with COVID-19 is urgently needed for decision making regarding hospitalization priority in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccination priority against COVID-19. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed by comprehensively searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and KoreaMed databases through August 25, 2021. The criteria for enrollment were ""severe COVID-19"" as poor outcomes (intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and/or death) and underlying comorbidities before SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Among 872 screened studies, 17 articles were included in the systematic review, and 10 articles were included in the meta-analysis.

18,35111161,"It is still controversial whether chronic lung inflammation increases the risk for COVID-19. One of the risk factors for acquiring COVID-19 is the level of expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, in lung tissue. It is, however, not clear how lung tissue inflammation affects expression levels of these receptors. We hence aimed to determine the level of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in lung tissue of asthmatic relative to age, gender, and asthma severity, and to investigate the factors regulating that. Therefore, gene expression data sets of well-known asthmatic cohorts (SARP and U-BIOPRED) were used to evaluate the association of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with age, gender of the asthmatic patients, and also the type of the underlying lung tissue inflammatory cytokines. Notably, ACE2 and to less extent TMPRSS2 expression were upregulated in the lung tissue of asthmatics compared to healthy controls. Although a differential expression of ACE2, but not TMPRSS2 was observed relative to age within the moderate and severe asthma groups, our data suggest that age may not be a key regulatory factor of its expression. The type of tissue inflammation, however, associated significantly with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels following adjusting with age, gender and oral corticosteroids use of the patient. Type I cytokine (IFN-gamma), IL-8, and IL-19 were associated with increased expression, while Type II cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) with lower expression of ACE2 in lung tissue (airway epithelium and/or lung biopsies) of moderate and severe asthmatic patients. Of note, IL-19 was associated with ACE2 expression while IL-17 was associated with TMPRSS2 expression in sputum of asthmatic subjects. In vitro treatment of bronchial fibroblasts with IL-17 and IL-19 cytokines confirmed the regulatory effect of these cytokines on SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors. Our results suggest that the type of inflammation may regulate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the lung tissue of asthmatics and may hence affect susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","It is still controversial whether chronic lung inflammation increases the risk for COVID-19.

Currently, a number of risk factors have been identified to have a potential impact on increasing the morbidity of COVID-19 in adults, including old age, male sex, pre-existing comorbidities, and racial/ethnic disparities. In addition to these factors, changes in laboratory indices and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as possible complications, could indicate the progression of COVID-19 into a severe and critical stage. Children predominantly suffer from mild illnesses due to COVID-19. Similar to adults, the main risk factors in pediatric patients include age and pre-existing comorbidities. In contrast, supplementation with a healthy diet and sufficient nutrition, COVID-19 vaccination, and atopic conditions may act as protective factors against the infection of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccination not only protects vulnerable individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection, more importantly, it may also reduce the development of severe disease and death due to COVID-19. Currently used therapies for COVID-19 are off-label and empiric, and their impacts on the severity and mortality of COVID-19 are still unclear.

In two prospective cohorts, early non-neutralizing, afucosylated immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were associated with progression from mild to more severe COVID-19. To study the biology of afucosylated IgG immune complexes, we developed an in vivo model that revealed that human IgG-Fc-gamma receptor (FcgammaR) interactions could regulate inflammation in the lung. Afucosylated IgG immune complexes isolated from patients with COVID-19 induced inflammatory cytokine production and robust infiltration of the lung by immune cells. In contrast to the antibody structures that were associated with disease progression, antibodies that were elicited by messenger RNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were highly fucosylated and enriched in sialylation, both modifications that reduce the inflammatory potential of IgG. Vaccine-elicited IgG did not promote an inflammatory lung response. These results show that human IgG-FcgammaR interactions regulate inflammation in the lung and define distinct lung activities mediated by the IgG that are associated with protection against, or progression to, severe COVID-19.","A damaging inflammatory response is implicated in the pathogenesis of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but mechanisms contributing to this response are unclear.

22,35027428,"INTRODUCTION: The impact of acute COVID-19 on people with asthma appears complex, being moderated by multiple interacting disease-specific, demographic and environmental factors. Research regarding longer-term effects in this group is limited. We aimed to assess impacts of COVID-19 and predictors of persistent symptoms, in people with asthma. METHODS: Using data from an online UK-wide survey of 4500 people with asthma (median age 50-59 years, 81% female), conducted in October 2020, we undertook a mixed methods analysis of the characteristics and experience of those reporting having had COVID-19. RESULTS: The COVID-19 group (n=471, 10.5%) reported increased inhaler use and worse asthma management, compared with those not reporting COVID-19, but did not differ by gender, ethnicity or household income. Among the COVID-19 group, 56.1% reported having long COVID, 20.2% were 'unsure'. Those with long COVID were more likely than those without long COVID to describe: their breathing as worse or much worse after their initial illness (73.7% vs 34.8%, p<0.001), increased inhaler use (67.8% vs 34.8%, p<0.001) and worse or much worse asthma management (59.6% vs 25.6%, p<0.001). Having long COVID was not associated with age, gender, ethnicity, UK nation or household income.Analysis of free text survey responses identified three key themes: (1) variable COVID-19 severity, duration and recovery; (2) symptom overlap and interaction between COVID-19 and asthma; (3) barriers to accessing healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: Persisting symptoms are common in people with asthma following COVID-19. Measures are needed to ensure appropriate healthcare access including clinical evaluation and investigation, to distinguish between COVID-19 symptoms and asthma.","INTRODUCTION: The impact of acute COVID-19 on people with asthma appears complex, being moderated by multiple interacting disease-specific, demographic and environmental factors.

In this study, we report the clinical characteristics of children classified as critical COVID-19 in Korea to provide further insights into risk factors and management in children. METHODS: This study was a retrospective case series of children < 18 years of age classified as critical COVID-19. Cases were identified by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency surveillance system and medical records were reviewed. Critical COVID-19 was defined as cases with severe illness requiring noninvasive (high flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure, or bilevel positive airway pressure) or invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), between January 20, 2020 and October 7, 2021. RESULTS: Among 39,146 cases diagnosed with COVID-19 in subjects < 18 years of age, eight cases (0.02%) were identified as critical COVID-19. The median age was 13 years (range 10 month-17 years) and male-to-female ratio was 1:1. Three children had underlying diseases; one child has asthma and major depressive disorder, one child had Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and one child had mental retardation and was newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus with the diagnosis of COVID-19. Among the eight children, seven were obese (body mass index range [BMI] median 29.3, range 25.9-38.2, weight-for-length > 97% for infant) and one was overweight (BMI 21.3). All patients had fever, six patients had dyspnea or cough and other accompanied symptoms included sore throat, headache, lethargy and myalgia. Radiologic findings showed pneumonia within 1-8 days after symptom onset. Pneumonia progressed in these children for 2-6 days and was improved within 5-32 days after diagnosis. Among the eight critical cases, remdesivir was administered in six cases. Steroids were provided for all cases. Inotropics were administered in one case. Six cases were treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilator and three required mechanical ventilator. One case required ECMO due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. All cases were admitted to the intensive care unit and admission period ranged from 9-39 days. Among all critical COVID-19 cases < 18 years of age, there were no fatal cases.

STUDY SELECTIONS: Primary manuscripts and abstracts using online and telephone surveys, mixed-method studies capturing patient and caregiver experiences, case studies, and published guidelines from allergic disease-specific expert groups were included. RESULTS: People with asthma and other chronic respiratory conditions are at higher risk of negative psychological outcomes, and risk factors include asthma severity, female sex, and previous history of anxiety and depression, likely owing to the perceived risk of severe disease from COVID-19. One study identified that people with allergic rhinitis had significantly high anxiety and depression scores compared with healthy controls (both, P < .001). The psychological impacts of food allergy during COVID-19 were most strongly felt by parents and caregivers. Similarly, parents of children with asthma experienced substantial psychological burden. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 had a considerable psychological impact on patients with asthma. Limited data have been published on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 on patients with allergic rhinitis and food allergy.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in pediat-ric asthma control. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, open, transversal study was performed at five ter-tiary hospitals. Recruited patients were aged <18 years and had physician-diagnosed asthma. Information regarding the 2019 and 2020 seasons were provided. RESULTS: Data were collected from 107 children (age range: 3-18 years, mean age: 12 years). Well-controlled asthma was observed in 58 (54.2%) patients in 2020 versus 30 (28%) in 2019, and 15 (14%) patients had poorly controlled asthma in 2020 versus 28 (26.2%) in 2019. In 2020, a decrease in exacerbations caused by allergies to pollen, dust mites, molds, and through other causes not related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed. An increase in exacerbations was observed due to animal dander, stress, physical exercise, and SARSCoV-2 infection. Children had a reduced need for asthma-controlling medication, made fewer visits to healthcare providers and had lesser need of treatment with oral corticosteroids if compared with the same season of 2019.

31,34922224,"BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence regarding the effect of asthma and its different therapeutic options on COVID-19 severity and the clinical outcomes. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) by asthmatic patients and the severity of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted from March 15 to October 23, 2020 and included data of all COVID-19 asthmatic patients (n=287) at King Abdulaziz Medical City. Twelve patients were excluded due to poor medication history documentation or using ICS for non-asthma indication. Ordinal logistic regression was used to determine the clinical variables that affect COVID-19 severity. The clinical outcomes of ICS and non-ICS users were compared. RESULTS: Of the sample (n=275), 198 (72%) were using ICS therapy. No significant difference was found between ICS and non-ICS users in disease severity (P=0.12), mortality (P=0.45), ICU admission (P=0.78), and the occurrence of complications. However, the number of days on ventilation were significantly increased in ICS users (P=0.006). Being prescribed the ICS/LABA combination (adj OR: 0.72 [0.15,1.2]; P=0.021), being hypertensive (adj OR: 0.98 [0.28,1.6]; P=0.006), having cancer (adj OR: 1.49 [0.12, 2.8]; P=0.033), or having diabetes (adj OR: 0.75 [0.09, 1.4]; P=0.024) could not increase the risk for more severe disease. CONCLUSION: Overall, ICS therapy did not alter the COVID-19 severity or mortality in asthmatic patients.

32,34911694,"As the world faces the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, concerns have been raised that asthma patients could be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. However, it appears that asthma is not an independent risk factor for both. Furthermore, asthma is not over-represented in hospitalised patients with severe pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and there was no increased risk of asthma exacerbations triggered by SARS-CoV-2. There is accumulating evidence that asthma phenotypes and comorbidities are important factors in evaluating the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity, as findings suggest that Th2-high inflammation may reduce the risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection and disease severity in contrast to increased risk in patients with Th2-low asthma. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is safe in asthma patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, it has been proposed that ICS may confer some degree of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of severe disease by reducing the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 and transmembrane protease serine in the lung. In contrast, chronic or recurrent use of systemic corticosteroids before SARS-CoV-2 infection is a major risk factor of poor outcomes and worst survival in asthma patients. Conversely, biological therapy for severe allergic and eosinophilic asthma does not increase the risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 or having worse COVID-19 severity.

33,34902435,"BACKGROUND: Treatments for coronavirus disease 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), are urgently needed but remain limited. SARS-CoV-2 infects cells through interactions of its spike (S) protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) on host cells. Multiple cells and organs are targeted, particularly airway epithelial cells. OM-85, a standardized lysate of human airway bacteria with strong immunomodulating properties and an impeccable safety profile, is widely used to prevent recurrent respiratory infections. We found that airway OM-85 administration inhibits Ace2 and Tmprss2 transcription in the mouse lung, suggesting that OM-85 might hinder SARS-CoV-2/host cell interactions. OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate whether and how OM-85 treatment protects nonhuman primate and human epithelial cells against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA and protein expression, cell binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein, cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-pseudotyped lentiviral particles, and SARS-CoV-2 cell infection were measured in kidney, lung, and intestinal epithelial cell lines, primary human bronchial epithelial cells, and ACE2-transfected HEK293T cells treated with OM-85 in vitro. RESULTS: OM-85 significantly downregulated ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcription and surface ACE2 protein expression in epithelial cell lines and primary bronchial epithelial cells. OM-85 also strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein binding to, SARS-CoV-2 S protein-pseudotyped lentivirus entry into, and SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells. These effects of OM-85 appeared to depend on SARS-CoV-2 receptor downregulation. CONCLUSIONS: OM-85 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 epithelial cell infection in vitro by downregulating SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression. Further studies are warranted to assess whether OM-85 may prevent and/or reduce the severity of coronavirus disease 2019.","BACKGROUND: Treatments for coronavirus disease 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), are urgently needed but remain limited.

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between allergic diseases and COVID-19 severity in pediatric patients. Methods: Seventy-five pediatric patients with COVID-19 were classified according to clinical severity and evaluated in the allergy/immunology and pulmonology departments 1 to 3 months after the infection resolved. Blood was collected from the patients for a complete blood cell count and assessment of immunoglobulin and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and skin-prick tests and spirometry tests were performed. Results: A total of 75 patients ages 5-18 years were evaluated. COVID-19 was asymptomatic/mild in 44 patients and moderate/severe/critical in 31 patients. Based on allergy evaluation, allergic rhinitis was diagnosed in 19 patients (25.3%), asthma in 10 patients (13%), and atopic dermatitis in 3 patients (4%).

Only limited data have been available to explore this hypothesis. Objective: To assess the interrelationship(s) between COVID-19 and HAE. Methods: Self-reported COVID-19 infection, complications, morbidity, and mortality were surveyed by using an online questionnaire. The participants included subjects with HAE with C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency (HAE-C1INH) and subjects with HAE with normal C1-inhibitor (HAE-nl-C1INH), and household controls (normal controls). The impact of HAE medications was examined. Results: A total of 1162 participants who completed the survey were analyzed, including: 695 subjects with HAE-C1INH, 175 subjects with HAE-nl-C1INH, and 292 normal controls. The incidence of reported COVID-19 was not significantly different between the normal controls (9%) and the subjects with HAE-C1INH (11%) but was greater in the subjects with HAE-nl-C1INH (19%; p = 0.006).

36,34869916,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dyspnea is one of the most common symptoms associated with the COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of dyspnea, observe co-variables, and find predictors of dyspnea after 2 months of recovery from COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 377 patients were included in the study based on their responses and clinical findings during initial admission to the hospital with COVID-19. After excluding five deceased patients, a total of 327 patients were interviewed through telephone using a 12-point dyspnea scale and using relevant questions to gauge the patient clinically. Interviews were carried out by trained physicians, and responses were recorded and stored. All analyses were carried out using the statistical programming language R. RESULTS: Of the total 327 participants in the study, 34% had stated that they were suffering from respiratory symptoms even after 2 months of COVID-19. The study demonstrated that patient oxygen saturation level SpO2 (P = .03), D-dimer (P = .001), serum ferritin (P = .006), and the presence and severity of dyspnea are significantly correlated. In addition to that, patient smoking history (P = .012) and comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P = .021) were found to be statistically significant among groups.

METHODS: A total of 377 patients were included in the study based on their responses and clinical findings during initial admission to the hospital with COVID-19. After excluding five deceased patients, a total of 327 patients were interviewed through telephone using a 12-point dyspnea scale and using relevant questions to gauge the patient clinically. Interviews were carried out by trained physicians, and responses were recorded and stored. All analyses were carried out using the statistical programming language R. RESULTS: Of the total 327 participants in the study, 34% had stated that they were suffering from respiratory symptoms even after 2 months of COVID-19. The study demonstrated that patient oxygen saturation level SpO2 (P = .03), D-dimer (P = .001), serum ferritin (P = .006), and the presence and severity of dyspnea are significantly correlated. In addition to that, patient smoking history (P = .012) and comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (P = .021) were found to be statistically significant among groups.

38,34856034,"BACKGROUND: Clinical presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among children with asthma have rarely been investigated. This study aimed to assess clinical manifestations and outcome of COVID-19 among children with asthma, and whether the use of asthma medications was associated with outcomes of interest. METHODS: The Global Asthma Network (GAN) conducted a global survey among GAN centers. Data collection was between November 2020 and April 2021. RESULTS: Fourteen GAN centers from 10 countries provided data on 169 children with asthma infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 was asymptomatic in 58 (34.3%), mild in 93 (55.0%), moderate in 14 (8.3%), and severe/critical in 4 (2.4%). Thirty-eight (22.5%) patients had exacerbation of asthma and 21 (12.4%) were hospitalized for a median of 7 days (interquartile range 3-16). Those who had moderate or more severe COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have exacerbation of asthma as compared to those who were asymptomatic or had mild COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio (adjOR) 3.97, 95% CI 1.23-12.84). Those who used inhaled bronchodilators were significantly more likely to have a change of asthma medications (adjOR 2.39, 95% CI 1.02-5.63) compared to those who did not. Children who used inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) did not differ from those who did not use ICS with regard to being symptomatic, severity of COVID-19, asthma exacerbation, and hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Over dependence on inhaled bronchodilator may be inappropriate. Use of ICS may be safe and should be continued in children with asthma during the pandemic of COVID-19.","BACKGROUND: Clinical presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among children with asthma have rarely been investigated.

METHODS: An observational longitudinal study was conducted during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (March 2020-March 2021). All pediatric patients attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinics of six tertiary referral hospitals in Madrid, Spain, with a diagnosis of RMD and COVID-19 were included. Main outcomes were symptomatic disease and hospital admission. The covariates were sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and treatment regimens. We ran a multivariable logistic regression model to assess associated factors for outcomes. RESULTS: The study population included 77 pediatric patients. Mean age was 11.88 (4.04) years Of these, 30 patients (38.96%) were asymptomatic, 41 (53.25%) had a mild-moderate COVID-19 and 6 patients (7.79%) required hospital admission. The median length of hospital admission was 5 (2-20) days, one patient required intensive care and there were no deaths. Previous comorbidities increased the risk for symptomatic disease and hospital admission. Compared with outpatients, the factor independently associated with hospital admission was previous use of glucocorticoids (OR 3.51; p = 0.00).

METHODS: In Spring 2019 and Spring 2020, we prospectively assessed monthly changes in pediatric asthma control test (c-ACT), asthma medication usage, infections and unscheduled visits for asthma among schoolchildren with active asthma in Cyprus and Greece. We compared asthma symptom control and other morbidity indices before and during lockdown measures, while participants' time spent at home was objectively assessed by wearable sensors. RESULTS: A total of 119 asthmatic children participated in the study during Spring 2020. Compared to a mean baseline (pre-COVID-19 lockdown) c-ACT score of 22.70, adjusted mean increases of 2.58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.91, 3.26, p < 0.001) and 3.57 (95% CI: 2.88, 4.27, p < 0.001) in the 2nd and 3rd monthly assessments were observed after implementation of lockdown measures. A mean increase in c-ACT score of 0.32 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.47, p < 0.001) was noted per 10% increase in the time spent at home. Improvement was more profound in children with severe asthma, while significant reductions in infections, asthma medication usage and unscheduled visits for asthma were also observed.

44,34775650,"BACKGROUND: Most pediatric studies of asthma and COVID-19 to date have been ecological, which offer limited insight. We evaluated the association between asthma and COVID-19 at an individual level. METHODS: Using data from prospective clinical registries, we conducted a nested case-control study comparing three groups: children with COVID-19 and underlying asthma (""A+C"" cases); children with COVID-19 without underlying disease (""C+"" controls); and children with asthma without COVID-19 (""A+"" controls). RESULTS: The cohort included 142 A+C cases, 1110 C+ controls, and 140 A+ controls. A+C cases were more likely than C+ controls to present with dyspnea and wheezing, to receive pharmacologic treatment including systemic steroids (all p < .01), and to be hospitalized (4.9% vs. 1.7%, p = .01). In the adjusted analysis, A+C cases were nearly 4 times more likely to be hospitalized than C+ controls (adjusted OR = 3.95 [95%CI = 1.4-10.9]); however, length of stay and respiratory support level did not differ between groups. Among A+C cases, 8.5% presented with an asthma exacerbation and another 6.3% developed acute exacerbation symptoms shortly after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Compared to historic A+ controls, A+C cases had less severe asthma, were less likely to be on controller medications, and had better asthma symptom control (all p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, asthma was a risk factor for hospitalization in children with COVID-19, but not for worse COVID-19 outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 does not seem to be a strong trigger for pediatric asthma exacerbations. Asthma severity was not associated with higher risk of COVID-19.","BACKGROUND: Most pediatric studies of asthma and COVID-19 to date have been ecological, which offer limited insight.

We sought to investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak that occurred in a highly dense population area in Colombo, Sri Lanka from April to May 2020. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We carried out RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV2, assessed the SARS-CoV-2 specific total and neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) in a densely packed, underserved settlement (n = 2722) after identification of the index case on 15th April 2020. 89/2722 individuals were detected as infected by RT-qPCR with a secondary attack rate among close contacts being 0.077 (95% CI 0.063-0.095). Another 30 asymptomatic individuals were found to have had COVID-19 based on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. However, only 61.5% of those who were initially seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 had detectable total antibodies at 120 to 160 days, while only 40.6% had detectable Nabs. 74/89 (83.1%) of RT-qPCR positive individuals were completely asymptomatic and all 15 (16.9%) who experienced symptoms were classified as having a mild illness. 18 (20.2%) were between the ages of 61 to 80. 11/89 (12.4%) had diabetes, 8/89 (9%) had cardiovascular disease and 4 (4.5%) had asthma.

We carried out a retrospective analysis using data from young patients who visited the PED with cutaneous or respiratory symptoms in the period from 20(th) February to 12(th) May of the years 2020 and 2019. Data on allergy and COVID-19 nasal swab were also collected. We observed eleven (28.2%) PED visits for allergic patients with respiratory or cutaneous symptoms for the period from 20(th) February to 12(th) May of the year 2020 and ninety-three (31.8%) PED visits for the same time frame of the year 2019 (p=0.645). Only a two-month-old child out of 39 patients with non-allergic respiratory or cutaneous symptoms resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we found for all the PED visits: 21 (7.2%) in 2019 vs 2 (5.1%) in 2020 for patients with urticaria/angioedema or atopic dermatitis (p=0.634); 3 (1.0%) in 2019 vs 3 (7.7%) in 2020 for patients with anaphylaxis (p=0.003); 19 (6.5%) in 2019 vs 2 (5.1%) in 2020 for those with asthma (p=0.740); 11(3.8%) in 2019 vs 1(2.6%) in 2020 for those with lower respiratory diseases, excluding asthma (p=0.706); 39(13.4%) in 2019 vs 3 (7.7%) in 2020 for those with upper respiratory diseases (URDs) (p=0.318). We also showed a substantial decrease (~80%) in all PED visits compared with the same time frame in 2019 (absolute number 263 vs 1,211, respectively). Among all the PED visits a significant reduction was mostly found for URDs [155 (12.8%) in 2019 vs 17 (6.5%) in 2020; p=0.045)]. The total number of PED visits for allergic patients with respiratory or cutaneous symptoms dropped precipitously in 2020. It is very tricky to estimate whether it was a protective action of allergy or the fear of contagion or the lockdown or a reduction in air pollution that kept children with allergy from visiting the PED.

47,34740944,"INTRODUCTION: Obstructive lung diseases (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) and smoking are associated with greater risk of respiratory infections and hospitalisations, but conflicting data exist regarding their association with severity of COVID-19, and few studies have evaluated whether these associations differ by age. OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations between asthma, COPD and smoking on the severity of COVID-19 among a cohort of hospitalised patients, and to test for effect modification by age. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data of patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital, assigning the maximal WHO Clinical Progression Scale score for each patient during the first 28 days following hospital admission. Using ordered logistic regression, we measured the association between maximal severity score and asthma, COPD and smoking and their interaction with age. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 1391 patients hospitalised with COVID-19, we found an increased risk of severe disease among patients with COPD and prior smoking, independent of age. We also found evidence of effect modification by age with asthma and current smoking; in particular, asthma was associated with decreased COVID-19 severity among older adults, and current smoking was associated with decreased severity among younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: This cohort study identifies age as a modifying factor for the association between asthma and smoking on severity of COVID-19. Our findings highlight the complexities of determining risk factors for COVID-19 severity, and suggest that the effect of risk factors may vary across the age spectrum.","INTRODUCTION: Obstructive lung diseases (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) and smoking are associated with greater risk of respiratory infections and hospitalisations, but conflicting data exist regarding their association with severity of COVID-19, and few studies have evaluated whether these associations differ by age.

We conducted a multicentre, prospective study of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 76 Spanish hospitals. We included children with COVID-19 or multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) younger than 18 years old, attended during the first year of the pandemic. We enrolled 1200 children. A total of 666 (55.5%) were hospitalised, and 123 (18.4%) required admission to PICU. Most frequent major clinical syndromes in the cohort were mild syndrome (including upper respiratory tract infection and flu-like syndrome, skin or mucosae problems and asymptomatic), 44.8%; bronchopulmonary syndrome (including pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma flare), 18.5%; fever without a source, 16.2%; MIS-C, 10.6%; and gastrointestinal syndrome, 10%. In hospitalised children, the proportions were 28.5%, 25.7%, 16.5%, 19.1% and 10.2%, respectively. Risk factors associated with PICU admission were age in months (OR: 1.007; 95% CI 1.004 to 1.01), MIS-C (OR: 14.4, 95% CI 8.9 to 23.8), chronic cardiac disease (OR: 4.8, 95% CI 1.8 to 13), asthma or recurrent wheezing (OR: 2.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.2) and after excluding MIS-C patients, moderate/severe liver disease (OR: 8.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 47.6). However, asthmatic children were admitted into the PICU due to MIS-C or pneumonia, not due to asthma flare.Conclusion: Hospitalised children with COVID-19 usually present as one of five major clinical phenotypes of decreasing severity. Risk factors for PICU include MIS-C, elevation of inflammation biomarkers, asthma, moderate or severe liver disease and cardiac disease. What is Known: * All studies suggest that children are less susceptible to serious SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared to adults. Most studies describe symptoms at presentation. However, it remains unclear how these symptoms group together into clinically identifiable syndromes and the severity associated with them. What is New: * We have gathered the primary diagnoses into five major syndromes of decreasing severity: MIS-C, bronchopulmonary syndrome, gastrointestinal syndrome, fever without a source and mild syndrome. Classification of the children in one of the syndromes is unique and helps to assess the risk of critical illness and to define the spectrum of the disease instead of just describing symptoms and signs.","We aimed to identify the spectrum of disease in children with COVID-19, and the risk factors for admission in paediatric intensive care units (PICUs).

49,34732518,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the experience of people who continue to be unwell after acute COVID-19, often referred to as 'long COVID', both in terms of their symptoms and their interactions with healthcare. DESIGN: We conducted a mixed-methods analysis of responses to a survey accessed through a UK online post-COVID-19 support and information hub, between April and December 2020, about people's experiences after having acute COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: 3290 respondents, 78% female, 92.1% white ethnicity and median age range 45-54 years; 12.7% had been hospitalised. 494(16.5%) completed the survey between 4 and 8 weeks of the onset of their symptoms, 641(21.4%) between 8 and 12 weeks and 1865 (62.1%) >12 weeks after.

50,34728408,"BACKGROUND: It remains unclear if patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and/or asthma are susceptible to corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, severity, and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of AR and/or asthma in COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality, and assess whether long-term AR and/or asthma medications affected the outcomes of COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of 70,557 adult participants completed SARS-CoV-2 testing between March 16 and December 31, 2020, in the UK Biobank were analyzed. The rates of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality in relation to pre-existing AR and/or asthma were assessed based on adjusted generalized linear models. We further analyzed the impact of long-term AR and/or asthma medications on the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS: Patients with AR of all ages had lower positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 tests (relative risk [RR]: 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.81, P < .001), with lower susceptibility in males (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65-0.85, P < .001) than females (RR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.72-0.9, P < .001). However, similar effects of asthma against COVID-19 hospitalization were only major in participants aged <65 (RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.86-1, P = .044) instead of elderlies. In contrast, patients with asthma tested positively had higher risk of hospitalization (RR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.32-1.54, P < .001). Neither AR nor asthma had an impact on COVID-19 mortality. None of conventional medications for AR or asthma, for example, antihistamines, corticosteroids, or beta2 adrenoceptor agonists, showed association with COVID-19 infection or severity. CONCLUSION: AR (all ages) and asthma (aged <65) act as protective factors against COVID-19 infection, whereas asthma increases risk for COVID-19 hospitalization. None of the long-term medications had a significant association with infection, severity, and mortality of COVID-19 among patients with AR and/or asthma.","BACKGROUND: It remains unclear if patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and/or asthma are susceptible to corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, severity, and mortality.

54,34710053,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 became a pandemic rapidly after its emergence in December 2019. It belongs to the coronavirus family of viruses, which have struck a few times before in history. Data based on previous research regarding etiology and epidemiology of other viruses from this family helped played a vital role in formulating prevention and precaution strategies during the initial stages of this pandemic. Data related to COVID-19 in Pakistan were not initially documented on a large scale. In addition, due to a weak health care system and low economic conditions, Pakistan's population, in general, already suffers from many comorbidities, which can severely affect the outcome of patients infected with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 infections are coupled with a manifestation of various notable outcomes that can be documented and characterized clinically. The aim of this study was to examine these clinical manifestations, which can serve as indicators for early detection as well as severity prognosis for COVID-19 infections, especially in high-risk groups. METHODS: A retrospective observational study involving abstraction of demographic features, presenting symptoms, and adverse clinical outcomes for 1812 patients with COVID-19 was conducted. Patients were admitted to the four major hospitals in the Rawalpindi-Islamabad region of Pakistan, and the study was conducted from February to August 2020. Multivariate regression analysis was carried out to identify significant indicators of COVID-19 severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ventilator aid, and mortality. The study not only relates COVID-19 infection with comorbidities, but also examines other related factors, such as age and gender. RESULTS: This study identified fever (1592/1812, 87.9%), cough (1433/1812, 79.1%), and shortness of breath (998/1812, 55.1%) at the time of hospital admission as the most prevalent symptoms for patients with COVID-19. These symptoms were common but not conclusive of the outcome of infection. Out of 1812 patients, 24.4% (n=443) required ICU admission and 21.5% (n=390) required ventilator aid at some point of disease progression during their stay at the hospital; 25.9% (n=469) of the patients died. Further analysis revealed the relationship of the presented symptoms and comorbidities with the progression of disease severity in these patients. Older adult patients with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and asthma, were significantly affected in higher proportions, resulting in requirement of ICU admission and ventilator aid in some cases and, in many cases, even mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Older adult patients with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and chronic kidney disease, are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infections, with an increased likelihood of adverse clinical outcomes.","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 became a pandemic rapidly after its emergence in December 2019.

We aimed to evaluate the effects of asthma and COPD on the susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19. METHODS: Data from a nationwide COVID-19 cohort database by the Korea National Health Insurance Corporation were utilized. A total of 4066 COVID-19 patients (1 January 2020 through 4 June 2020) were 1:4 matched with 16,264 controls with regard to age, sex, and income. Asthma and COPD were defined as diagnostic codes (ICD-10) and medication claim codes. Conditional and unconditional multivariate logistic regression were applied to analyze the susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 associated with asthma and COPD. RESULTS: The prevalence of mild and severe asthma/COPD did not differ between the COVID-19 and control patients in the multivariate analyses. Among the total 4066 COVID-19 patients, 343 (8.4%) had severe COVID-19, of whom 132 (3.2% of the total COVID-19 patients) died.

57,34678637,"BACKGROUND: Age, sex, race and comorbidities are insufficient to explain why some individuals remain asymptomatic after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while others die. In this sense, the increased risk caused by the long-term exposure to air pollution is being investigated to understand the high heterogeneity of the COVID-19 infection course. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the underlying effect of long-term exposure to NO2 and PM10 on the severity and mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted with 2112 patients suffering COVID-19 infection. We built two sets of multivariate predictive models to assess the relationship between the long-term exposure to NO2 and PM10 and COVID-19 outcome. First, the probability of either death or severe COVID-19 outcome was predicted as a function of all the clinical variables together with the pollutants exposure by means of two regularized logistic regressions. Subsequently, two regularized linear regressions were constructed to predict the percentage of dead or severe patients. Finally, odds ratios and effects estimates were calculated. RESULTS: We found that the long-term exposure to PM10 is a more important variable than some already stated comorbidities (i.e.: COPD/Asthma, diabetes, obesity) in the prediction of COVID-19 severity and mortality. PM10 showed the highest effects estimates (1.65, 95% CI 1.32-2.06) on COVID-19 severity. For mortality, the highest effect estimates corresponded to age (3.59, 95% CI 2.94-4.40), followed by PM10 (2.37, 95% CI 1.71-3.32). Finally, an increase of 1 microg/m(3) in PM10 concentration causes an increase of 3.06% (95% CI 1.11%-4.25%) of patients suffering COVID-19 as a severe disease and an increase of 2.68% (95% CI 0.53%-5.58%) of deaths. DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that long-term PM10 burdens above WHO guidelines exacerbate COVID-19 health outcomes. Hence, WHO guidelines, the air quality standard established by the Directive 2008/50/EU, and that of the US-EPA should be updated accordingly to protect human health.","BACKGROUND: Age, sex, race and comorbidities are insufficient to explain why some individuals remain asymptomatic after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while others die.

58,34669568,"Rationale: Studies have suggested some patients with asthma are at risk of severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but they have had limited data on asthma phenotype and have not considered if risks are specific to COVID-19. Objectives: To determine the effect of asthma phenotype on three levels of COVID-19 outcomes. Compare hospitalization rates with influenza and pneumonia. Methods: Electronic medical records were used to identify patients with asthma and match them to the general population. Patient-level data were linked to Public Health England severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test data, hospital, and mortality data. Asthma was phenotyped by medication, exacerbation history, and type 2 inflammation. The risk of each outcome, adjusted for major risk factors, was measured using Cox regression. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 434,348 patients with asthma and 748,327 matched patients were included. All patients with asthma had a significantly increased risk of a General Practice diagnosis of COVID-19. Asthma with regular inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.61), intermittent ICS plus add-on asthma medication use (HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.43-2.79), regular ICS plus add-on use (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.37-1.94), or with frequent exacerbations (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.34-2.47) was significantly associated with hospitalization.

59,34649490,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with Coagulopathy (CAC) and Venous Thromboembolism (VTE). These are well-reported complications of COVID-19 infection. Earlier publications have shown that CAC and thromboembolism are predictors of mortality among COVID-19 patients with severe disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where all confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled and followed until death or ICU discharge. CAC, VTE, along with all comorbidities, were recorded. Predictors of mortality were determined by univariate and multivariate regression. RESULTS: Among 261 patients with COVID-19, 48.3% survived and 51.7% died. CAC was present in 53.2% and 76.3% of the survivors and non-survivors, respectively (p<0.001); 89 patients (31.4%) had VTE (p=0.36) and 11 patients (4.2%) had arterial thrombosis (p=0.76) among survivors and nonsurvivors.

61,34613896,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the clinical factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity in children and adolescents. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study across 45 US children's hospitals between April 2020 to September 2020 of pediatric patients discharged with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19. We assessed factors associated with hospitalization and factors associated with clinical severity (eg, admission to inpatient floor, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], admission to ICU with mechanical ventilation, shock, death) among those hospitalized. RESULTS: Among 19,976 COVID-19 encounters, 15,913 (79.7%) patients were discharged from the emergency department (ED) and 4063 (20.3%) were hospitalized. The clinical severity distribution among those hospitalized was moderate (3222, 79.3%), severe (431, 11.3%), and very severe (380, 9.4%). Factors associated with hospitalization vs discharge from the ED included private payor insurance (adjusted odds ratio [aOR],1.16; 95% CI, 1.1-1.3), obesity/type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) (aOR, 10.4; 95% CI, 8.9-13.3), asthma (aOR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.6), cardiovascular disease, (aOR, 5.0; 95% CI, 4.3- 5.8), immunocompromised condition (aOR, 5.9; 95% CI, 5.0-6.7), pulmonary disease (aOR, 5.3; 95% CI, 3.4-8.2), and neurologic disease (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.7-5.8). Among children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19, greater disease severity was associated with Black or other non-White race; age greater than 4 years; and obesity/type 2 DM, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and pulmonary conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Among children and adolescents presenting to US children's hospital EDs with COVID-19, 20% were hospitalized; of these, 21% received care in the ICU.

62,34610047,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected 1.9% of the world population by May 2, 2021. Since most previous studies that examined risk factors for mortality and severity were based on hospitalized individuals, population-based cohort studies are called for to provide evidence that can be extrapolated to the general population. Therefore, we aimed to examine the associations of comorbidities with mortality and disease severity in individuals with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Ontario, Canada. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all individuals with COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada diagnosed between January 15 and December 31, 2020. Cases were linked to health administrative databases maintained in the ICES which covers all residents in Ontario. The primary outcome is all-cause 30-day mortality after the first COVID-19 diagnosis, and the secondary outcome is a composite severity index containing death and hospitalization. To examine the risk factors for the outcomes, we employed Cox proportional hazards regression models and logistic regression models to adjust for demographic, socio-economic variables and comorbidities. Results were also stratified by age groups. A total of 167,500 individuals were diagnosed of COVID-19 in 2020 and included in the study. About half (43.8%, n = 73,378) had at least one comorbidity. The median follow-up period were 30 days. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (24%, n = 40,154), asthma (16%, n = 26,814), and diabetes (14.7%, n = 24,662). Individuals with comorbidity had higher risk of mortality compared to those without (HR = 2.80, 95%CI 2.35-3.34; p<0.001), and the risk substantially was elevated from 2.14 (95%CI 1.76-2.60) to 4.81 (95%CI 3.95-5.85) times as the number of comorbidities increased from one to five or more. Significant predictors for mortality included comorbidities such as solid organ transplant (HR = 3.06, 95%CI 2.03-4.63; p<0.001), dementia (HR = 1.46, 95%CI 1.35-1.58; p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (HR = 1.45, 95%CI 1.34-1.57; p<0.001), severe mental illness (HR = 1.42, 95%CI%, 1.12-1.80; p<0.001), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (HR = 1.22, 95%CI, 1.15-1.30), diabetes (HR = 1.19, 95%, 1.12-1.26; p<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR = 1.19, 95%CI 1.12-1.26; p<0.001), cancer (HR = 1.17, 95%CI, 1.09-1.27; p<0.001), hypertension (HR = 1.16, 95%CI, 1.07-1.26; p<0.001). Compared to their effect in older age groups, comorbidities were associated with higher risk of mortality and severity in individuals under 50 years old. Individuals with five or more comorbidities in the below 50 years age group had 395.44 (95%CI, 57.93-2699.44, p<0.001) times higher risk of mortality compared to those without. Limitations include that data were collected during 2020 when the new variants of concern were not predominant, and that the ICES databases do not contain detailed individual-level socioeconomic and racial variables. CONCLUSION: We found that solid organ transplant, dementia, chronic kidney disease, severe mental illness, CVD, hypertension, COPD, cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV, and asthma were associated with mortality or severity. Our study highlights that the number of comorbidities was a strong risk factor for deaths and severe outcomes among younger individuals with COVID-19. Our findings suggest that in addition of prioritizing by age, vaccination priority groups should also include younger population with multiple comorbidities.","BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected 1.9% of the world population by May 2, 2021.

63,34607870,"OBJECTIVES: This study explores the hospital journey of patients with intellectual disabilities (IDs) compared with the general population after admission for COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic (when demand on inpatient resources was high) to identify disparities in treatment and outcomes. DESIGN: Matched cohort study; an ID cohort of 506 patients were matched based on age, sex and ethnicity with a control group using a 1:3 ratio to compare outcomes from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK. SETTING: Admissions for COVID-19 from UK hospitals; data on symptoms, severity, access to interventions, complications, mortality and length of stay were extracted. INTERVENTIONS: Non-invasive respiratory support, intubation, tracheostomy, ventilation and admission to intensive care units (ICU). RESULTS: Subjective presenting symptoms such as loss of taste/smell were less frequently reported in ID patients, whereas indicators of more severe disease such as altered consciousness and seizures were more common. Controls had higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors, asthma, rheumatological disorder and smoking. ID patients were admitted with higher respiratory rates (median=22, range=10-48) and were more likely to require oxygen therapy (35.1% vs 28.9%). Despite this, ID patients were 37% (95% CI 13% to 57%) less likely to receive non-invasive respiratory support, 40% (95% CI 7% to 63%) less likely to receive intubation and 50% (95% CI 30% to 66%) less likely to be admitted to the ICU while in hospital. They had a 56% (95% CI 17% to 102%) increased risk of dying from COVID-19 after they were hospitalised and were dying 1.44 times faster (95% CI 1.13 to 1.84) compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: There have been significant disparities in healthcare between people with ID and the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have contributed to excess mortality in this group.","OBJECTIVES: This study explores the hospital journey of patients with intellectual disabilities (IDs) compared with the general population after admission for COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic (when demand on inpatient resources was high) to identify disparities in treatment and outcomes.

Here, we aim to identify the risk factors for COVID-19 severity and compare patients between the first-third waves and the fourth wave. METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective study of COVID-19 cases at the National Hospital Organization Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center. RESULTS: We identified 404 patients (median age: 71.0 years [interquartile range: 56.0-80.0]), of whom 199 (49.1%) had mild disease, 142 (35.2%) had moderate disease, and 63 (15.6%) had severe disease. The overall mortality rate was 5.4% (22/404). Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, cardiovascular disease, fever, dyspnea, and several inflammatory biomarkers were independent risk factors for moderate to severe disease. For every 1 mg/dL increase in C-reactive protein, 10 IU/L increase in lactate dehydrogenase, and 100 ng/mL increase in ferritin, the risk for moderate to severe disease increased by 18.3%, 12.9%, and 8.9%, respectively. Overall disease severity in the fourth wave was higher than in the first-third waves. However, there was no significant difference in mortality. Because of a shortage of beds, four of the 28 severe patients (14.3%) in the fourth wave could not be transferred to the advanced hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular disease, fever, dyspnea, and several inflammatory biomarkers were risk factors for moderate to severe COVID-19 in our cohort. During the fourth wave, COVID-19 severity worsened, increasing the number of patients who could not be transferred to beds for severe cases, resulting in a medical crisis in Osaka.","BACKGROUND: The fourth wave of COVID-19 in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, caused a medical crisis.

68,34550036,"BACKGROUND: The potential protective role of eosinophils in the COVID-19 pandemic has aroused great interest, given their potential virus clearance function and the infection resistance of asthma patients to this coronavirus. However, it is unknown whether eosinophil counts could serve as a predictor of the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 1004 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China, were enrolled in this study, including 905 patients in the general ward and 99 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We reviewed their medical data to analyze the association between eosinophils and ICU admission and death. RESULTS: Of our 1004 patients with COVID-19, low eosinophil counts/ratios were observed in severe cases. After adjusting for confounders that could have affected the outcome, we found that eosinophil counts might not be a predictor of ICU admission. In 99 ICU patients, 58 of whom survived and 41 of whom died, low eosinophil level was an indicator of death in severe COVID-19 patients with a cutoff value of 0.04 x 10(9)/L, which had an area under the curve of 0.665 (95% CI = 1.089-17.839; P = .045) with sensitivity and specificity of 0.569 and 0.7317, respectively.

Asthma affects approximately 262 million people worldwide and is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Presently, it appears asthma is neither associated with an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 nor with a risk of severe COVID-19 or COVID-19 related death. Regarding the severe asthma patients on biologics, questions remain. The purpose of this review is to discuss the evidence regarding the relationship between asthma, biologics and COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: The available evidence does not suggest that severe asthmatics on treatment with biologics have a higher risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection compared to the general population.

70,34540855,"Introduction: Given the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the consequent global healthcare crisis, there is an urgent need to better understand risk factors for symptom deterioration and mortality among patients with COVID-19. This systematic review aimed to meet the need by determining the predictive value of chronic diseases for COVID-19 severity and mortality. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Complete to identify studies published between December 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Two hundred and seventeen observational studies from 26 countries involving 624,986 patients were included. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies and performed a cumulative meta-analysis. Results: We found that among COVID-19 patients, hypertension was a very common condition and was associated with higher severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mortality. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the strongest predictor for COVID-19 severity, admission to ICU, and mortality, while asthma was associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality. Patients with obesity were at a higher risk of experiencing severe symptoms of COVID-19 rather than mortality. Patients with cerebrovascular disease, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, or cancer were more likely to become severe COVID-19 cases and had a greater probability of mortality. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with chronic diseases were more likely to experience severe symptoms and ICU admission and faced a higher risk of mortality. Aggressive strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic should target patients with chronic diseases as a priority.","Introduction: Given the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the consequent global healthcare crisis, there is an urgent need to better understand risk factors for symptom deterioration and mortality among patients with COVID-19.

71,34535175,"BACKGROUND: The importance of clinicolaboratory characteristics of COVID-19 made us report our findings in the Alborz province according to the latest National Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in outpatients and inpatients (trial five versions, 25 March 2020) of Iran by emphasizing rRT-PCR results, clinical features, comorbidities, and other laboratory findings in patients according to the severity of the disease. METHODS: In this study, 202 patients were included, primarily of whom 164 had fulfilled the inclusion criteria. This cross-sectional, two-center study that involved 164 symptomatic adults hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 5 and April 5, 2020, was performed to analyze the frequency of rRT-PCR results, distribution of comorbidities, and initial clinicolaboratory data in severe and non-severe cases, comparing the compatibility of two methods for categorizing the severity of the disease. RESULTS: According to our findings, 111 patients were rRT-PCR positive (67.6%), and 53 were rRT-PCR negative (32.4%), indicating no significant difference between severity groups that were not related to the date of symptoms' onset before admission. Based on the National Guideline, among vital signs and symptoms, mean oxygen saturation and frequency of nausea showed a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05); however, no significant difference was observed in comorbidities. In CURB-65 groups, among vital signs and comorbidities, mean oxygen saturation, diabetes, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, chronic heart disease (CHD), and asthma showed a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was seen in symptoms. CONCLUSION: In this study, rRT-PCR results of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were not related to severity categories. From initial clinical characteristics, decreased oxygen saturation appears to be a more common abnormality in severe and non-severe categories. National Guideline indices seem to be more comprehensive to categorize patients in severity groups than CURB-65, and there was compatibility just in non-severe groups of National Guideline and CURB-65 categories.","BACKGROUND: The importance of clinicolaboratory characteristics of COVID-19 made us report our findings in the Alborz province according to the latest National Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in outpatients and inpatients (trial five versions, 25 March 2020) of Iran by emphasizing rRT-PCR results, clinical features, comorbidities, and other laboratory findings in patients according to the severity of the disease.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has proposed moderate to severe asthma as a risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. However, current evidences have not identified asthma in the top 10 comorbidities associated with COVID-19 fatalities. It raises the question that why patients with different type of asthma are not more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection like other respiratory infection. Increased number of eosinophils and elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressions in asthma are supposed as two mechanisms which associated with decreased COVID-19 susceptibility in asthmatics. Some studies have been performed to evaluate two mentioned factors in asthmatic patients compared with healthy individuals. Herein, we address these mechanisms and investigate whether ACE2 and eosinophil could protect asthmatic patients against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","SUMMARY: Currently, the world is engaged with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection.

However, these studies focus exclusively on the reinfected case, without considering the epidemiological context of the event. Our objectives were to perform a complete analysis of the sequential infections and community transmission events around a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, including the infection events preceding it, the exposure, and subsequent transmissions. Our analysis was supported by host genetics, viral whole-genome sequencing, phylogenomic viral population analysis, and refined epidemiological data obtained from interviews with the involved subjects. The reinfection involved a 53-year-old woman with asthma (Case A), with a first COVID-19 episode in April 2020 and a much more severe second episode 4-1/2 months later, with SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in August, that required hospital admission. An extended genomic analysis allowed us to demonstrate that the strain involved in Case A's reinfection was circulating in the epidemiological context of Case A and was also transmitted subsequently from Case A to her family context. The reinfection was also supported by a phylogenetic analysis, including 348 strains from Madrid, which revealed that the strain involved in the reinfection was circulating by the time Case A suffered the second episode, August-September 2020, but absent at the time range corresponding to Case A's first episode.

75,34492508,"OBJECTIVES: The role of overcrowded and multigenerational households as a risk factor for COVID-19 remains unmeasured. The objective of this study is to examine and quantify the association between overcrowded and multigenerational households and COVID-19 in New York City (NYC). STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: We conducted a Bayesian ecological time series analysis at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level in NYC to assess whether ZCTAs with higher proportions of overcrowded (defined as the proportion of the estimated number of housing units with more than one occupant per room) and multigenerational households (defined as the estimated percentage of residences occupied by a grandparent and a grandchild less than 18 years of age) were independently associated with higher suspected COVID-19 case rates (from NYC Department of Health Syndromic Surveillance data for March 1 to 30, 2020). Our main measure was an adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of suspected COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population. Our final model controlled for ZCTA-level sociodemographic factors (median income, poverty status, White race, essential workers), the prevalence of clinical conditions related to COVID-19 severity (obesity, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, asthma, smoking status, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and spatial clustering. RESULTS: 39,923 suspected COVID-19 cases were presented to emergency departments across 173 ZCTAs in NYC. Adjusted COVID-19 case rates increased by 67% (IRR 1.67, 95% CI = 1.12, 2.52) in ZCTAs in quartile four (versus one) for percent overcrowdedness and increased by 77% (IRR 1.77, 95% CI = 1.11, 2.79) in quartile four (versus one) for percent living in multigenerational housing. Interaction between both exposures was not significant (betainteraction = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Overcrowdedness and multigenerational housing are independent risk factors for suspected COVID-19.

76,34490415,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been increasing urgency to identify pathophysiological characteristics leading to severe clinical course in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human leukocyte antigen alleles (HLA) have been suggested as potential genetic host factors that affect individual immune response to SARS-CoV-2. We sought to evaluate this hypothesis by conducting a multicenter study using HLA sequencing. METHODS: We analyzed the association between COVID-19 severity and HLAs in 435 individuals from Germany (n = 135), Spain (n = 133), Switzerland (n = 20) and the United States (n = 147), who had been enrolled from March 2020 to August 2020. This study included patients older than 18 years, diagnosed with COVID-19 and representing the full spectrum of the disease. Finally, we tested our results by meta-analysing data from prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS). FINDINGS: We describe a potential association of HLA-C*04:01 with severe clinical course of COVID-19. Carriers of HLA-C*04:01 had twice the risk of intubation when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (risk ratio 1.5 [95% CI 1.1-2.1], odds ratio 3.5 [95% CI 1.9-6.6], adjusted p-value = 0.0074). These findings are based on data from four countries and corroborated by independent results from GWAS. Our findings are biologically plausible, as HLA-C*04:01 has fewer predicted bindings sites for relevant SARS-CoV-2 peptides compared to other HLA alleles. INTERPRETATION: HLA-C*04:01 carrier state is associated with severe clinical course in SARS-CoV-2.

77,34481456,"BACKGROUND: Pre-existing comorbidities have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection but evidence is sparse on the importance and pattern of multimorbidity (2 or more conditions) and severity of infection indicated by hospitalisation or mortality. We aimed to use a multimorbidity index developed specifically for COVID-19 to investigate the association between multimorbidity and risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We used data from the UK Biobank linked to laboratory confirmed test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality data from Public Health England between March 16 and July 26, 2020. By reviewing the current literature on COVID-19 we derived a multimorbidity index including: (1) angina; (2) asthma; (3) atrial fibrillation; (4) cancer; (5) chronic kidney disease; (6) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; (7) diabetes mellitus; (8) heart failure; (9) hypertension; (10) myocardial infarction; (11) peripheral vascular disease; (12) stroke. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess the association between multimorbidity and risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (hospitalisation/death). Potential effect modifiers of the association were assessed: age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, body mass index, air pollution, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, cardiorespiratory fitness, high sensitivity C-reactive protein. RESULTS: Among 360,283 participants, the median age was 68 [range 48-85] years, most were White (94.5%), and 1706 had severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of multimorbidity was more than double in those with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (25%) compared to those without (11%), and clusters of several multimorbidities were more common in those with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most common clusters with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were stroke with hypertension (79% of those with stroke had hypertension); diabetes and hypertension (72%); and chronic kidney disease and hypertension (68%). Multimorbidity was independently associated with a greater risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted odds ratio 1.91 [95% confidence interval 1.70, 2.15] compared to no multimorbidity). The risk remained consistent across potential effect modifiers, except for greater risk among older age. The highest risk of severe infection was strongly evidenced in those with CKD and diabetes (4.93 [95% CI 3.36, 7.22]). CONCLUSION: The multimorbidity index may help identify individuals at higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes and provide guidance for tailoring effective treatment.","BACKGROUND: Pre-existing comorbidities have been linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection but evidence is sparse on the importance and pattern of multimorbidity (2 or more conditions) and severity of infection indicated by hospitalisation or mortality.

78,34476916,"INTRODUCTION: Allergic diseases could play a role of a predisposing factor for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to investigate allergic comorbidity and its association in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Demographic data, clinical manifestations, laboratory reports, and radiologic findings, together with underlying comorbidity of patients, were studies. Allergic diseases were identified by using the standard GA(2)LEN questionnaire. The severity of COVID-19 was assessed by a visual analog scale (VAS) and an intensive care unit (ICU) report. RESULTS: Out of 400 COVID-19 patients admitted in the hospital, 158 (39.5%) presented with different allergic diseases, and a reverse association was observed between having allergic comorbidity and severity of COVID-19 infection (P = 0.005, relative risk = 0.96; 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): 0.77-1.19). The respective frequency of asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR), chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), atopic dermatitis, chronic urticaria, and food or drug allergy was 7.3%, 16%, 1.8%, 5%, 10% and 13.3%. Significantly, only AR was reversely associated with the severity of COVID-19 (P = 0.02, relative risk = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.77-1.19). Additionally, 43% of the patients presented hypoxemia, and 93.5% had chest CT scan involvement. Interestingly, patients with allergic diseases had significantly lower hypoxemia and chest CT involvement as compared with non-allergic patients (P = 0.002 and 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results of this study established that allergic diseases were not determined to be a predisposing factor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

79,34474710,"Background: The demonstration that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the cell via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor has raised concerns that, in hereditary angioedema (HAE), a disease characterized by bradykinin-mediated angioedema attacks, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may trigger angioedema attacks, increase the frequency and/or severity of attacks, or cause more severe symptoms of COVID-19. Objective: The objective was to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 in patients with HAE, the course of HAE attacks, angioedema activity, and the quality-of-life scores during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Patients diagnosed with HAE for at least 6 months were included in the study. The 7-day Angioedema Activity Score and the Angioedema Quality of Life (AE-QoL) Questionnaire were first completed at the onset of the pandemic between March 12 and June 1, 2020, then during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in the third month after recovering from COVID-19. Results: Ten of 67 patients with HAE (14.9%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The median (interquartile range) age of the 10 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was 35.5 years (28.0-55.0 years). Six of the 10 patients (60%) were women. During COVID-19, five of the 10 patients (50%) had no angioedema attack. Two patients with severe HAE experienced a significant increase in angioedema activity during COVID-19 compared with their basal activity scores. The remaining three patients had a similar or lower attack frequency than their basal level. Four (40%) of the 10 patients had a relative increase in their attacks during the convalescence period. There was no statistically significant difference among pre-COVID-19, during COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 periods in function, mood, fear and/or shame, nutrition, and total scores of the AE-QoL Questionnaire although the fear dimension was relatively more affected (p = 0.06). Conclusion: Although the sample size was small, analysis of our data supported that the symptoms of COVID-19 were not more severe in HAE. Also, there was no significant difference in the AE-QoL Questionnaire scores, the frequency, and severity of angioedema attacks during the course of COVID-19 in the patients with HAE.","Background: The demonstration that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the cell via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor has raised concerns that, in hereditary angioedema (HAE), a disease characterized by bradykinin-mediated angioedema attacks, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may trigger angioedema attacks, increase the frequency and/or severity of attacks, or cause more severe symptoms of COVID-19.

81,34467518,"INTRODUCTION: Assessing the risk factors for and consequences of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy is essential to guide clinical care. Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy have been among hospitalized patients, which may have exaggerated risk estimates of severe outcomes because all cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pregnant population were not included. The objectives of this study were to identify risk factors for and outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy independent of severity of infection in a universally tested population, and to identify risk factors for and outcomes after severe infection requiring hospital admission. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective population-based cohort study in Denmark using data from the Danish National Patient Register and Danish Microbiology Database and prospectively registered data from medical records. We included all pregnancies between March 1 and October 31, 2020 and compared women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during pregnancy to non-infected pregnant women. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were both identified prospectively and through register linkage to ensure that all cases were identified and that cases were pregnant during infection. Main outcome measures were pregnancy, delivery, maternal, and neonatal outcomes. Severe infection was defined as hospital admission due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. RESULTS: Among 82 682 pregnancies, 418 women had SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, corresponding to an incidence of 5.1 per 1000 pregnancies, 23 (5.5%) of which required hospital admission due to COVID-19. Risk factors for infection were asthma (odds ratio [OR] 2.19, 95% CI 1.41-3.41) and being foreign born (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.70-2.64). Risk factors for hospital admission due to COVID-19 included obesity (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.00-7.51), smoking (OR 4.69, 95% CI 1.58-13.90), infection after gestational age (GA) 22 weeks (GA 22-27 weeks: OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.16-12.29; GA 28-36 weeks: OR 4.76, 95% CI 1.60-14.12), and having asthma (OR 4.53, 95% CI 1.39-14.79).

METHODS: We estimated the 10-year (2009-2018) PM2.5 exposure at the residential zip code of COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University of Cincinnati healthcare system between 13 March 2020 and 30 September 2020. Logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI for COVID-19 hospitalizations associated with PM2.5 , adjusting for socioeconomic characteristics and comorbidities. RESULTS: Among the 14,783 COVID-19 patients included in our study, 13.6% were hospitalized; the geometric mean (SD) PM2.5 was 10.48 (1.12) mug/m(3) . In adjusted analysis, 1 mug/m(3) increase in 10-year annual average PM2.5 was associated with 18% higher hospitalization (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.11-1.26). Likewise, 1 mug/m(3) increase in PM2.5 estimated for the year 2018 was associated with 14% higher hospitalization (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.08-1.21). CONCLUSION: Long-term PM2.5 exposure is associated with increased hospitalization in COVID-19.

This study aimed to examine the relationship between COVID-19 transport restrictions and hospital admissions because of RSD in Dublin city and county for 2020. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective population-based cohort. METHODS: Admission data were collected from the Health Service Executive Hospital In-patient Enquiry. Daily count of hospital admissions with Dublin city and county address with primary diagnosis of RSD was performed. The daily air nitrogen dioxide (NO2) data were obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). RESULTS: During the period of transport restrictions, there was a reduction in the annual mean NO2 from 25 mug/m(3) to 17 mug/m(3) (P < 0.001), and decreases in hospital admissions for RSD were observed. Among the 9934 patient episodes included in this study, the mean age at admission was 61.5 years, 57.8% were female (n = 5744), and mean (standard deviation) length of stay was 7.5 (13.52) days. CONCLUSION: This study, using routinely gathered data, suggests that decreases in ambient NO2 as related to COVID-19 transport restrictions were significantly associated with lower asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admissions.","AIM: Exposure to poor air quality is a well-established factor for exacerbation of respiratory system diseases (RSDs); whether air pollutants are a cause of the development of RSD, however, remains unclear.

84,34452063,"The recent appearance of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and has brought to light the importance of understanding this highly pathogenic agent to prevent future pandemics. This virus is from the same single-stranded positive-sense RNA family, Coronaviridae, as two other epidemic-causing viruses, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. During this pandemic, one crucial focus highlighted by WHO has been to understand the risk factors that may contribute to disease severity and predict COVID-19 outcomes. In doing so, it is imperative to understand the virology of SARS-CoV-2 and the immunological response eliciting the clinical manifestation and progression of COVID-19. In this review, we provide clinical data-based analyses of how multiple risk factors (such as sex, race, HLA genotypes, blood groups, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, smoking, and asthma) contribute to the inflammatory overactivation and cytokine storm (frequently seen in COVID-19 patients) with a focus on the IL-6 pathway. We also draw comparisons to the virulence and pathophysiology of SARS and MERS to establish parallels in immune response and discuss the potential for therapeutic approaches that may limit disease progression in patients with higher risk profiles than others. Moreover, we cover the latest information on approved or upcoming COVID-19 vaccines. This paper also provides perspective on emerging variants and associated opportunistic infections such as black molds and fungus that have added to mortality in some parts of the world, such as India. This compilation of existing COVID-19 studies and data will provide an excellent referencing tool for the research, clinical, and public health communities.","The recent appearance of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and has brought to light the importance of understanding this highly pathogenic agent to prevent future pandemics.

DNAm data from the Isle of Wight birth cohort (IOWBC) at birth, 10, 18, and 26 years of age were included. Linear mixed models with repeated measurements stratified by sex were used to examine temporal patterns, and cluster analysis was performed to identify CpGs following similar patterns. CpGs on autosomes and sex chromosomes were analyzed separately. The association of identified CpGs and expression of their genes were evaluated. Pathway enrichment analyses of the genes was conducted at FDR = 0.05. DNAm at 635 of the 1146 CpGs on autosomes showed statistically significant time effects (FDR = 0.05). The 635 CpGs were classified into five clusters with each representing a unique temporal pattern of DNAm. Of the 29 CpGs on sex chromosomes, DNAm at seven CpGs in males and eight CpGs in females showed time effects (FDR = 0.05). Sex-specific and non-specific associations of DNAm with gene expression were found at 24 and 93 CpGs, respectively. Genes which mapped the 643 CpGs represent 460 biological processes.

86,34428181,"There is an urgent need to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for severe COVID-19 that results in death. We initially performed both untargeted and targeted lipidomics as well as focused biochemical analyses of 127 plasma samples and found elevated metabolites associated with secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity and mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with severe COVID-19. Deceased COVID-19 patients had higher levels of circulating, catalytically active sPLA2 group IIA (sPLA2-IIA), with a median value that was 9.6-fold higher than that for patients with mild disease and 5.0-fold higher than the median value for survivors of severe COVID-19. Elevated sPLA2-IIA levels paralleled several indices of COVID-19 disease severity (e.g., kidney dysfunction, hypoxia, multiple organ dysfunction). A decision tree generated by machine learning identified sPLA2-IIA levels as a central node in the stratification of patients who died from COVID-19. Random forest analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-based (LASSO-based) regression analysis additionally identified sPLA2-IIA and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) as the key variables among 80 clinical indices in predicting COVID-19 mortality. The combined PLA-BUN index performed significantly better than did either one alone. An independent cohort (n = 154) confirmed higher plasma sPLA2-IIA levels in deceased patients compared with levels in plasma from patients with severe or mild COVID-19, with the PLA-BUN index-based decision tree satisfactorily stratifying patients with mild, severe, or fatal COVID-19. With clinically tested inhibitors available, this study identifies sPLA2-IIA as a therapeutic target to reduce COVID-19 mortality.","There is an urgent need to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for severe COVID-19 that results in death.

87,34425811,"BACKGROUND: How cigarette smoke (CS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection and severity is controversial. We investigated the effects of COPD and CS on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in vivo in COPD patients and controls and in CS-exposed mice, and the effects of CS on SARS-CoV-2 infection in human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. METHODS: We quantified: (1) pulmonary ACE2 protein levels by immunostaining and ELISA, and both ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 mRNA levels by RT-qPCR in two independent human cohorts; and (2) pulmonary ACE2 protein levels by immunostaining and ELISA in C57BL/6 WT mice exposed to air or CS for up to 6 months. The effects of CS exposure on SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated after in vitro infection of Calu-3 cells and differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), respectively. RESULTS: ACE2 protein and mRNA levels were decreased in peripheral airways from COPD patients versus controls but similar in central airways. Mice exposed to CS had decreased ACE2 protein levels in their bronchial and alveolar epithelia versus air-exposed mice. CS treatment decreased viral replication in Calu-3 cells, as determined by immunofluorescence staining for replicative double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and western blot for viral N protein. Acute CS exposure decreased in vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication in HBECs, as determined by plaque assay and RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 levels were decreased in both bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells from COPD patients versus controls, and from CS-exposed versus air-exposed mice. CS-pre-exposure potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro.

88,34422204,"BACKGROUND: While global health agencies have listed asthma as a vulnerability for severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the evidence supporting this is scarce. METHODS: A nationwide cohort study was conducted using the validated Korean national health insurance claim data of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1 and April 8, 2020. Asthma comorbidity was determined using a diagnosis code assigned by the physician and the prescription of asthma-related medications. The clinical course of COVID-19 was classified into 3 severity grades according to the requirements for oxygen supply and mechanical ventilation. We also evaluated the association of asthma with overall and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. RESULTS: Asthma morbidity was a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 (grade 2 requiring oxygen supply) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.341, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.051-1.711, P = 0.018) and grade 3 requiring mechanical ventilation or leading to death (aOR = 1.723, 95% CI: 1.230-2.412, P = 0.002) multinomial logistic regression adjusting co-risk factors. Asthma was also significantly associated with mortality of COVID-19 (aOR = 1.453, 95% CI: 1.015-2.080, P = 0.041) and was revealed to have a shorter time to in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 (P < 0.001).

90,34406300,"OBJECTIVE: Failure to achieve high levels of medication adherence in obstructive lung diseases is a major cause of uncontrolled disease. The purpose of this study is to reveal clinicians' opinions on the level of patient adherence and the change in adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A questionnaire containing multiple-choice questions about treatment adherence in patients with obstructive lung diseases was voluntarily applied to doctors working in a tertiary hospital for chest diseases. RESULTS: Eighty-one doctors (mean age, 37.2 years [standard deviation, 9.7 years]; 57 (70.4%) women) answered the questionnaires. Almost all clinicians participating in the study reported that they always or frequently asked patients if they adhered to treatment. Most clinicians think that in 20-50% of patients with asthma and less than 20% of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a decrease in medication adherence appears in the first year of treatment. Most clinicians think the main reason for patients with obstructive lung diseases not adhering is patients' reluctance to be treated regularly. Regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients' drug adherence, 43.2% of clinicians observed that adherence increased after the start of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to medication is not at the desired levels in patients with obstructive lung diseases. However, when faced with a serious health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, patients realize the severity of their illness and begin using their treatments more regularly.","OBJECTIVE: Failure to achieve high levels of medication adherence in obstructive lung diseases is a major cause of uncontrolled disease.

91,34404358,"BACKGROUND: Curcumin, a derivative of the spice turmeric, has been adopted by Eastern medicine for centuries as an adjunct to treat several medical conditions (e.g., anorexia and arthritis) because of its well-established anti-inflammatory properties. Studies have shown that the use of curcumin in mice models has led to reduction in several inflammatory markers as well as key inflammatory pathway enzymes. As a result, studies in Western medicine have developed to determine if this recognized benefit can be utilized for patients with inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma. This study will seek to better understand if curcumin can be used as an adjunctive therapy for improving asthma control of patients with moderate to severe asthma; a finding we hope will allow for a more affordable treatment. METHODS: This study will utilize a randomized, placebo controlled, double blinded pilot superiority phase 2 trial at an outpatient pulmonary clinic in Southern California, USA. Subjects will be receiving Curcumin 1500 mg or matching placebo by mouth twice daily for the study period of 12 weeks. Subjects will be randomized to either a placebo or intervention Curcumin. Subjects will have 6 clinic visits: screening visit, a baseline visit, monthly clinic visits (weeks 4, 8, and 12), at weeks 4, 8, and a follow-up clinic visit or phone-call (week 16). Changes in asthma control test scores, number of days missed from school/work, FEV1 (% predicted), FEV1/FVC ratio, FVC (% predicted), blood eosinophil count, blood total IgE, and FeNO levels will be compared by group over time. DISCUSSION: The therapeutic effects of curcumin have been studied on a limited basis in asthmatics and has shown mixed results thus far. Our study hopes to further establish the benefits of curcumin, however, there are potential issues that may arise from our study design that we will address within this paper. Moreover, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in safety concerns that have delayed initiation of our study. This study will contribute to existing literature on curcumin's role in reducing lung inflammation as it presents in asthmatics as well as patients suffering from COVID-19.

94,34389242,"BACKGROUND: Current studies of asthma history on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes are limited and lack consideration of disease status. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a population-based study to assess asthma disease status and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in relation to COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 61,338) in a large, diverse integrated health care system were identified. Asthma/COPD history, medication use, and covariates were extracted from electronic medical records. Asthma patients were categorized into those with and without clinical visits for asthma 12 or fewer months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and labeled as active and inactive asthma, respectively. Primary outcomes included COVID-19-related hospitalizations, intensive respiratory support (IRS), and intensive care unit admissions within 30 days, and mortality within 60 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Logistic and Cox regression were used to relate COVID-19 outcomes to asthma/COPD history. RESULTS: The cohort was 53.9% female and 66% Hispanic and had a mean age of 43.9 years. Patients with active asthma had increased odds of hospitalization, IRS, and intensive care unit admission (odds ratio 1.47-1.66; P < .05) compared with patients without asthma or COPD. No increased risks were observed for patients with inactive asthma. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with increased risks of hospitalization, IRS, and mortality (odds ratio and hazard ratio 1.27-1.67; P < .05). Among active asthma patients, those using asthma medications had greater than 25% lower odds for COVID-19 outcomes than those without medication. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with asthma who required clinical care 12 or fewer months prior to COVID-19 or individuals with COPD history are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Proper medication treatment for asthma may lower this risk.","BACKGROUND: Current studies of asthma history on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes are limited and lack consideration of disease status.

95,34351922,"Evidence for the real impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on preterm birth is unclear, as available series report composite pregnancy outcomes and/or do not stratify patients according to disease severity. The purpose of the research was to determine the real impact of asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection on preterm birth not due to maternal respiratory failure. This case-control study involved women admitted to Sant Anna Hospital, Turin, for delivery between 20 September 2020 and 9 January 2021. The cumulative incidence of Coronavirus disease-19 was compared between preterm birth (case group, n = 102) and full-term delivery (control group, n = 127).

This study aims to describe clinical and demographic features of COVID-19 patients and the influence of various risk factors on the severity of disease. METHODS: This research is a retrospective study based on Saudi Arabia's ministry of health's Covid-19 data. The analysis relies on data of all COVID-19 patients recorded in Riyadh between 1st, March 2020 and 30th, July 2020. Statistical analyses were performed to investigate the effect of demographic characteristic, clinical presentation, and comorbidities on infection severity. RESULTS: A total number of 1026 COVID-19 patients were identified based on the demographic data as follows: 709 cases (69% of cases) were males and 559 cases (54% of cases) were Saudi. Most of patients were diagnosed with mild signs and symptoms 697 (68% of cases), while 164 patient (16% of cases) demonstrated moderate signs and symptoms, and 103 cases (10%) were severe and 62 (6%) had critical febrile illness. Fever, cough, sore throat, and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms among patients with COVID-19. Among studied comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the most prevalent. The results from the bivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that older age, diabetes mellitus, asthma, smoking, and fever are associated with severe or critically ill cases. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show that old age, fever, and comorbidities involving diabetes mellitus, asthma, and smoking were significantly associated with infection severity.","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is newly emerging infectious disease that spread globally at unpredictable and unique pattern to the extent that the World Health Organization announced COVID-19 as a pandemic in the first couple months of 2020.

97,34335580,"Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19, but the mechanisms are unclear. Besides, patients with severe COVID-19 have been reported to have increased levels of several immune mediators. Methods: Ninety-two proteins were quantified in 315 plasma samples from 118 asthmatics, 99 COPD patients and 98 healthy controls (age 40-90 years), who were recruited in Colombia before the COVID-19 pandemic. Protein levels were compared between each disease group and healthy controls. Significant proteins were compared to the gene signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in the ""COVID-19 Drug and Gene Set Library"" and with experimentally tested protein biomarkers of severe COVID-19. Results: Forty-one plasma proteins showed differences between patients and controls. Asthmatic patients have increased levels in IL-6 while COPD patients have a broader systemic inflammatory dysregulation driven by HGF, OPG, and several chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CX3CL1, CXCL1, MCP-3, MCP-4, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL11). These proteins are involved in chemokine signaling pathways related with response to viral infections and some, were found up-regulated upon SARS-CoV-2 experimental infection of Calu-3 cells as reported in the COVID-19 Related Gene Sets database. An increase of HPG, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL-6, MCP-3, TNF and EN-RAGE has also been experimentally detected in patients with severe COVID-19. Conclusions: COPD patients have altered levels of plasma proteins that have been reported increased in patients with severe COVID-19. Our study suggests that COPD patients have a systemic dysregulation in chemokine networks (including HGF and CXCL9) that could make them more susceptible to severe COVID-19. Also, that IL-6 levels are increased in some asthmatic patients (especially in females) and this may influence their response to COVID-19. The findings in this study depict a novel panel of inflammatory plasma proteins in COPD patients that may potentially associate with increased susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and might be useful as a biomarker signature after future experimental validation.","Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19, but the mechanisms are unclear.

This study investigated demographic and clinical risk factors for severe disease and readmission among young adults 18-29 years old, who were diagnosed at a hospital encounter in Houston, Texas, USA. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A retrospective registry-based chart review was conducted investigating demographic and clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19 among patients aged 18-29 with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within a large metropolitan healthcare system in Houston, Texas, USA. In the cohort of 1,853 young adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection at a hospital encounter, including 226 pregnant women, 1,438 (78%) scored 0 on the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and 833 (45%) were obese (>/=30 kg/m2). Within 30 days of their diagnostic encounter, 316 (17%) patients were diagnosed with pneumonia, 148 (8%) received other severe disease diagnoses, and 268 (14%) returned to the hospital after being discharged home. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-1.2, p<0.001), male gender (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7, p = 0.002), Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.1, p = 0.01), obesity (3.1, 95% CI 1.9-5.1, p<0.001), asthma history (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.0, p = 0.003), congestive heart failure (aOR 6.0, 95% CI 1.5-25.1, p = 0.01), cerebrovascular disease (aOR 4.9, 95% CI 1.7-14.7, p = 0.004), and diabetes (aOR 3.4, 95% CI 1.9-6.2, p<0.001) were predictive of severe disease diagnoses within 30 days.

We aimed to describe the independent risk factors for estimating the severity of the COVID-19 in children. All children between 1 month and 18 years old who were hospitalized during the period of March 11-December 31, 2020, resulting from COVID-19 were included in the study. Patients were categorized into mild (group 1) and moderate + severe/critically (group 2) severity based on the criteria. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory variables between the two groups were compared. A total of 292 children confirmed to have COVID-19 infection were included in the study. The most common associated diseases were obesity (5.1%) and asthma bronchiale (4.1%). We observed that disease progressed more severely in patients with underlying diseases, especially obesity and asthma bronchiale (for patients with obesity odds ratio [OR] 9.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.92-43.28, p = 0.005 and for patients with asthma bronchiale OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.04-16.80, p = 0.044). In group 2 patients, presence of lymphopenia and hypoalbuminemia, and also an elevation in serum levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and uric acid were detected and these results were statistically significant (p values; p < 0.001, p = 0.046, p = 0.006, p = 0.045, p < 0.001, respectively). The strongest predictor of moderate-severe COVID-19 infections in the children was uric acid, with an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% CI 1.14-2.13, p = 0.005) and lymphocytes with an odds ratio of 0.7 (95% CI 0.55-0.88, p = 0.003). Although children are less susceptible to COVID-19, the pre-existing comorbid condition can predispose to severe disease. In addition, lymphopenia and high uric acid are indicators that COVID-19 infection may progress more severely.","Although the underlying disease is associated with a severe course in adults and laboratory abnormalities have been widely reported, there are not sufficient data on the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children with pre-existing comorbid conditions and on laboratory findings.

102,34271803,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the symptoms and laboratory results of children hospitalised with the diagnosis of COVID-19, aiming to reveal the characteristics of symptomatic cases. STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Pediatrics, Kastamonu Training and Research Hospital, Kastamonu, Turkey from March to December 2020. METHODOLOGY: Seventy-nine children, hospitalised with the diagnosis of COVID-19, were included in the study and were divided into two groups as symptomatic and asymptomatic. The demographic data, laboratory results and clinics of the patients of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 10.43 +/- 5.91 (0-17) years, and 57% (n=45) of them were girls. Five patients in the symptomatic group had comorbidities (2 allergic asthma, cerebral palsy, type-1 diabetes mellitus and anorexia nervosa). The most common symptom was fever (36.7%, n=29). It was noteworthy that everyone with an NLR >3.13 (high-NLR) was symptomatic. Significantly more patients in the high-NLR group were symptomatic compared with the low-NLR group (p=0.005). On the other hand, symptomatic children had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (2.8 (IQR: 1.2-10.0) mg/L vs. 1.4 (IQR: 0.4-2.0) mg/L, p=0.011); and procalcitonin (0.05 (IQR: 0.02-0.10) ng/mL vs. 0.01 (IQR: 0.00-0.03) ng/mL, p<0.001) than those without symptoms. One of the children with cerebral palsy died from pneumonia during the study. CONCLUSION: C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and NLR levels were found to be significantly higher in symptomatic children.

We assessed the risk of mortality based on the presence of comorbidities and organ-specific sequelae in 7,032 CoV2 positive (+) patients. Prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities was high among SARS-CoV2+ individuals. Diabetes, obesity, coronary artery disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure all increased overall mortality risk, while asthma did not. Ethnicity modified the risk of mortality associated with these comorbidities. With regards to secondary complications in the setting of infection, individuals with acute kidney injury and acute myocardial injury showed an increase in mortality risk. Cerebral infarcts and acute venous thromboembolic events were not associated with increased risk of mortality. Biomarkers for cardiovascular injury, coagulation, and inflammation were compared between deceased and survived individuals. We found that cardiac and coagulation biomarkers were elevated and fell beyond normal range more often in deceased patients.

108,34210785,"A central feature of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is that some individuals become severely ill or die, whereas others have only a mild disease course or are asymptomatic. Here we report development of an improved multimeric alphabeta T cell staining reagent platform, with each maxi-ferritin ""spheromer"" displaying 12 peptide-MHC complexes. Spheromers stain specific T cells more efficiently than peptide-MHC tetramers and capture a broader portion of the sequence repertoire for a given peptide-MHC.

109,34198852,"Epithelial characteristics underlying the differential susceptibility of chronic asthma to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and other viral infections are currently unclear. By revisiting transcriptomic data from patients with Th2 low versus Th2 high asthma, as well as mild, moderate, and severe asthmatics, we characterized the changes in expression of human coronavirus and influenza viral entry genes relative to sex, airway location, and disease endotype. We found sexual dimorphism in the expression of SARS-CoV-2-related genes ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and SLC6A19. ACE2 receptor downregulation occurred specifically in females in Th2 high asthma, while proteases broadly assisting coronavirus and influenza viral entry, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4, were highly upregulated in both sexes. Overall, changes in SARS-CoV-2-related gene expression were specific to the Th2 high molecular endotype of asthma and different by asthma severity and airway location. The downregulation of ACE2 (COVID-19, SARS) and ANPEP (HCoV-229E) viral receptors wascorrelated with loss of club and ciliated cells in Th2 high asthma. Meanwhile, the increase in DPP4 (MERS-CoV), ST3GAL4, and ST6GAL1 (influenza) was associated with increased goblet and basal activated cells. Overall, this study elucidates sex, airway location, disease endotype, and changes in epithelial heterogeneity as potential factors underlying asthmatic susceptibility, or lack thereof, to SARS-CoV-2.","Epithelial characteristics underlying the differential susceptibility of chronic asthma to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and other viral infections are currently unclear.

112,34171232,"BACKGROUND: A more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2, the variant of concern 202012/01 or lineage B.1.1.7, has emerged in the UK. We aimed to estimate the risk of critical care admission, mortality in patients who are critically ill, and overall mortality associated with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with non-B.1.1.7. We also compared clinical outcomes between these two groups. METHODS: For this observational cohort study, we linked large primary care (QResearch), national critical care (Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre Case Mix Programme), and national COVID-19 testing (Public Health England) databases. We used SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with S-gene molecular diagnostic assay failure (SGTF) as a proxy for the presence of lineage B.1.1.7. We extracted two cohorts from the data: the primary care cohort, comprising patients in primary care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported between Nov 1, 2020, and Jan 26, 2021, and known SGTF status; and the critical care cohort, comprising patients admitted for critical care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported between Nov 1, 2020, and Jan 27, 2021, and known SGTF status. We explored the associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection with and without lineage B.1.1.7 and admission to a critical care unit (CCU), 28-day mortality, and 28-day mortality following CCU admission. We used Royston-Parmar models adjusted for age, sex, geographical region, other sociodemographic factors (deprivation index, ethnicity, household housing category, and smoking status for the primary care cohort; and ethnicity, body-mass index, deprivation index, and dependency before admission to acute hospital for the CCU cohort), and comorbidities (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and hypertension for the primary care cohort; and cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, metastatic disease, and immunocompromised conditions for the CCU cohort). We reported information on types and duration of organ support for the B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 groups. FINDINGS: The primary care cohort included 198 420 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these, 117 926 (59.4%) had lineage B.1.1.7, 836 (0.4%) were admitted to CCU, and 899 (0.4%) died within 28 days. The critical care cohort included 4272 patients admitted to CCU. Of these, 2685 (62.8%) had lineage B.1.1.7 and 662 (15.5%) died at the end of critical care. In the primary care cohort, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 2.15 (95% CI 1.75-2.65) for CCU admission and 1.65 (1.36-2.01) for 28-day mortality for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with the non-B.1.1.7 group. The adjusted HR for mortality in critical care, estimated with the critical care cohort, was 0.91 (0.76-1.09) for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with those with non-B.1.1.7 infection. INTERPRETATION: Patients with lineage B.1.1.7 were at increased risk of CCU admission and 28-day mortality compared with patients with non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2. For patients receiving critical care, mortality appeared to be independent of virus strain. Our findings emphasise the importance of measures to control exposure to and infection with COVID-19.

Methacholine (MCH) acts by inducing airway tightening/bronchoconstriction, and more importantly, MCH is hydrolyzed by cholinesterase enzyme (ChE). Recently, the American Thoracic Society raised concerns about pulmonary function testing during the COVID-19 pandemic due to recently reported correlation between cholinesterase and COVID-19 pneumonia severity/mortality, and it was shown that cholinesterase levels are reduced in the acute phase of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

We aimed to describe the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Brazilian IEI patients and identify factors influencing the infection. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional, multicenter study that included patients of any age affected by IEI and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The variables studied were sex, age, type of IEI, comorbidities (number and type), treatment in use for IEI, clinical manifestations and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: 121 patients were included: 55.4% female, ages from six months to 74 yo (median age = 25.1 yo). Most patients had predominantly antibody deficiency (n = 53). The infection was mostly asymptomatic (n = 21) and mild (n = 66), and one child had multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). We could not observe sex-related susceptibility, and there was a weak correlation between age and severity of infection. The number of comorbidities was higher in severe cases, particularly bronchiectasis and cardiopathy. There were no severe cases in hereditary angioedema patients. Six patients aged 2 to 74 years died, three of them with antibody deficiency. CONCLUSION: The outcome was mild in most patients, but the Case Fatality Ratio was higher than in the general population. However, the type of IEI was not a determining factor for severity, except for complement deficiencies linked to milder COVID-19. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be more related to older age, a higher number of comorbidities and type of comorbidities (bronchiectasis and cardiopathy).","PURPOSE: There is still scarce data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI) and many unresolved questions.

116,34149705,"BACKGROUND: Studies on the role of eosinophils in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce, though available findings suggest a possible association with disease severity. Our study analyzes the relationship between eosinophils and COVID-19, with a focus on disease severity and patients with underlying chronic respiratory diseases. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 3018 subjects attended at two public hospitals in Madrid (Spain) with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 31 to April 17, 2020. Patients with eosinophil counts less than 0.02x10(9)/L were considered to have eosinopenia. Individuals with chronic respiratory diseases (n=384) were classified according to their particular underlying condition, i.e., asthma, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, or obstructive sleep apnea. RESULTS: Of the 3018 patients enrolled, 479 were excluded because of lack of information at the time of admission. Of 2539 subjects assessed, 1396 patients presented an eosinophil count performed on admission, revealing eosinopenia in 376 cases (26.93%). Eosinopenia on admission was associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU) or respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) admission (OR:2.21; 95%CI:1.42-3.45; p<0.001) but no increased risk of mortality (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Eosinopenia on admission conferred a higher risk of severe disease (requiring ICU/RICU care), but was not associated with increased mortality.

117,34144110,"BACKGROUND: Managing severe asthma during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is challenging, particularly due to safety concerns regarding the use of systemic corticosteroids and biologics. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the association between biologics or systemic corticosteroids use and PCR positivity for SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes among asthmatic patients. METHODS: We used the computerized database of Clalit Health Services, the largest health care provider in Israel, to identify all asthmatic adult patients who underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, between March 1, 2020, and December 7, 2020. A cohort approach was used to assess the association between biologics use and steroids treatment and COVID-19 severity and 90-day mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 8,242 of 80,602 tested asthmatic patients had positive PCR testing result for SARS-CoV-2. Both biologics and systemic corticosteroids were not associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariate analyses revealed that biologics were not associated with a significantly increased risk of moderate to severe COVID-19, nor with the composite end point of moderate to severe COVID-19 or all-cause mortality within 90 days. Chronic systemic corticosteroid use was associated with significantly increased risk of all tested outcome. Recent (within the previous 120 days) systemic corticosteroid use, but not former use, was significantly associated with increased risk of both moderate to severe COVID-19 and the composite of moderate to severe COVID-19 or all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Biologics approved for asthma and systemic corticosteroids are not associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, systemic corticosteroids are an independent risk factor for worst COVID-19 severity and all-cause mortality. Our findings underscore the risk of recent or current exposure to systemic corticosteroids in asthmatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","BACKGROUND: Managing severe asthma during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is challenging, particularly due to safety concerns regarding the use of systemic corticosteroids and biologics.

119,34126579,"INTRODUCTION: Organ tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to the respiratory tract could potentially aggravate asthma. The susceptibility of patients with asthma to develop an exacerbation when they are infected with SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. We aimed to investigate the symptoms presented in patients with asthma who became infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients over 14 years of age who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (by RT-PCR) were included (n = 2995). In patients with asthma (n = 77, 2.6%; 44 females), symptoms, therapy and phenotype were recorded. Seventeen (22%) patients had mild asthma, 55 (71%) moderate and five severe (6%). Twenty-six patients with asthma (34%) were asymptomatic, 34 (44%) developed symptoms but did not require hospital admission, and 17 (22%) were hospitalised. One patient was admitted because of asthma exacerbation without pneumonia or other symptoms. Ten patients (13%) had wheezes (six with pneumonia). Comparison of wheezing between patients with non-T2 asthma and the rest of the patients was statistically significant, (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection is not a significant cause of asthma exacerbation, although some patients may present wheezing, especially in cases of pneumonia. The severity of asthma does not seem to be associated with symptoms of the disease.","INTRODUCTION: Organ tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to the respiratory tract could potentially aggravate asthma.

120,34126003,"BACKGROUND: Acute asthma exacerbations are a common cause for emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in children. Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the education system closure/total lockdown in Israel on March 2020, we have noticed a decrease in pediatric ED visits and an increase in hospitalizations of asthma exacerbations. OBJECTIVE: to examine the patterns of ED visits for asthma exacerbations during COVID-19 outbreak, in comparison to the previous year. METHODS: A retrospective study comparing asthma related ED visits and hospitalizations among children aged 2-18 years at a tertiary center in southern Israel. Three time periods were selected: 2020 A (prelockdown, 2/1/20 to 3/14/20), 2020 B (lockdown, 3/15/20 to 5/15/20) and 2020 C (postlockdown, 5/16/20 to 6/30/20) and compared to the three parallel time periods in 2019. Data regarding demographics, number of ED visits and clinical severity parameters were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Five hundred and twelve children visited the ED for asthma exacerbation: 273 children during 2019 and 239 children during 2020. Lockdown period in 2020 revealed significantly fewer ED visits per day compared to the parallel calendar period in 2019 (1.8 vs. 1.43, p < .001). Significantly higher hospitalization rate (47.1% vs. 33.7%, p = .05) and longer length of stay (3.15 vs. 1.9 days, p = .03) were observed during the lockdown. CONCLUSION: Lockdown is associated with fewer ED visits for asthma exacerbation, probably due to; reduced exposure to viral infections and environmental allergens, decreased availability of primary physicians and families' reluctance to arrive to the ED. ED visits during lockdown were characterized by higher hospitalization rate and longer LOS.","BACKGROUND: Acute asthma exacerbations are a common cause for emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in children.

DATA SOURCES - STUDY SELECTION: We performed an extensive search of current literature in the databases PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar for original articles. We decided to include all types of articles, except for case studies, published until the end of February 2021 focusing on the effects of COVID-19 on the respiratory system and the main treatment recommendations up to date for patients with bronchial asthma. RESULTS: Until now there is no clear evidence that asthmatics have a higher risk of experiencing exacerbations when infected, nor higher mortality rates than the general population. Nevertheless, our knowledge on molecular pathways behind asthma phenotypes in the past decades is growing, and it underlines the need to predict the unique response each patient may have to infection from the novel coronavirus. It is not clear yet if certain sub-populations of asthmatics are at higher risk than others. CONCLUSION: Despite the lack of evidence for higher susceptibility and/or mortality in relation to COVID-19, all asthmatic patients, whether treated with inhaled bronchodilators/corticosteroids or even biologics, should maintain their controller therapy without making any alterations.","OBJECTIVES: It is well established in international literature that respiratory viruses can trigger asthma exacerbations.

122,34100692,"BACKGROUND: Men reportedly suffer from a more severe disease and higher mortality during the global SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) pandemic. We analysed sex differences in a low epidemic area with low overall mortality in Covid-19 in a population based setting with patients treated in specialized healthcare. METHODS: We entered all hospitalized laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases of all specialized healthcare hospitals of the Capital Province of Finland, into a population-based quality registry and described demographics, severity and case-fatality by sex of the first Covid-19 wave February-June 2020. RESULTS: Altogether 5471 patients (49% male) were identified. Patients hospitalized in the specialist healthcare (N = 585, 54% male, OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.05-1.48) were of the same age.

123,34097050,"Importance: Information on underlying conditions and severe COVID-19 illness among children is limited. Objective: To examine the risk of severe COVID-19 illness among children associated with underlying medical conditions and medical complexity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included patients aged 18 years and younger with International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification code U07.1 (COVID-19) or B97.29 (other coronavirus) during an emergency department or inpatient encounter from March 2020 through January 2021. Data were collected from the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release, which included data from more than 800 US hospitals. Multivariable generalized linear models, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were used to estimate adjusted risk of severe COVID-19 illness associated with underlying medical conditions and medical complexity. Exposures: Underlying medical conditions and medical complexity (ie, presence of complex or noncomplex chronic disease). Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalization and severe illness when hospitalized (ie, combined outcome of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death). Results: Among 43465 patients with COVID-19 aged 18 years or younger, the median (interquartile range) age was 12 (4-16) years, 22943 (52.8%) were female patients, and 12491 (28.7%) had underlying medical conditions. The most common diagnosed conditions were asthma (4416 [10.2%]), neurodevelopmental disorders (1690 [3.9%]), anxiety and fear-related disorders (1374 [3.2%]), depressive disorders (1209 [2.8%]), and obesity (1071 [2.5%]). The strongest risk factors for hospitalization were type 1 diabetes (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 4.60; 95% CI, 3.91-5.42) and obesity (aRR, 3.07; 95% CI, 2.66-3.54), and the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness were type 1 diabetes (aRR, 2.38; 95% CI, 2.06-2.76) and cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies (aRR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.48-1.99). Prematurity was a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness among children younger than 2 years (aRR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.47-2.29). Chronic and complex chronic disease were risk factors for hospitalization, with aRRs of 2.91 (95% CI, 2.63-3.23) and 7.86 (95% CI, 6.91-8.95), respectively, as well as for severe COVID-19 illness, with aRRs of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.69-2.26) and 2.86 (95% CI, 2.47-3.32), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness among children with medical complexity and certain underlying conditions, such as type 1 diabetes, cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies, and obesity. Health care practitioners could consider the potential need for close observation and cautious clinical management of children with these conditions and COVID-19.","Importance: Information on underlying conditions and severe COVID-19 illness among children is limited.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included patients aged 18 years and younger with International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification code U07.1 (COVID-19) or B97.29 (other coronavirus) during an emergency department or inpatient encounter from March 2020 through January 2021. Data were collected from the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release, which included data from more than 800 US hospitals. Multivariable generalized linear models, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were used to estimate adjusted risk of severe COVID-19 illness associated with underlying medical conditions and medical complexity. Exposures: Underlying medical conditions and medical complexity (ie, presence of complex or noncomplex chronic disease). Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalization and severe illness when hospitalized (ie, combined outcome of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death). Results: Among 43465 patients with COVID-19 aged 18 years or younger, the median (interquartile range) age was 12 (4-16) years, 22943 (52.8%) were female patients, and 12491 (28.7%) had underlying medical conditions. The most common diagnosed conditions were asthma (4416 [10.2%]), neurodevelopmental disorders (1690 [3.9%]), anxiety and fear-related disorders (1374 [3.2%]), depressive disorders (1209 [2.8%]), and obesity (1071 [2.5%]). The strongest risk factors for hospitalization were type 1 diabetes (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 4.60; 95% CI, 3.91-5.42) and obesity (aRR, 3.07; 95% CI, 2.66-3.54), and the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness were type 1 diabetes (aRR, 2.38; 95% CI, 2.06-2.76) and cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies (aRR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.48-1.99). Prematurity was a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness among children younger than 2 years (aRR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.47-2.29). Chronic and complex chronic disease were risk factors for hospitalization, with aRRs of 2.91 (95% CI, 2.63-3.23) and 7.86 (95% CI, 6.91-8.95), respectively, as well as for severe COVID-19 illness, with aRRs of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.69-2.26) and 2.86 (95% CI, 2.47-3.32), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study found a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness among children with medical complexity and certain underlying conditions, such as type 1 diabetes, cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies, and obesity.

125,34055680,"Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted by pediatric infectious disease specialists from 32 different hospitals from all over Turkey by case record forms. Pediatric cases who were diagnosed as COVID-19 between March 16, 2020, and June 15, 2020 were included. Case characteristics including age, sex, dates of disease onset and diagnosis, family, and contact information were recorded. Clinical data, including the duration and severity of symptoms, were also collected. Laboratory parameters like biochemical tests and complete blood count, chest X-ray, and chest computed tomography (CT) were determined. Results: There were 1,156 confirmed pediatric COVID-19 cases. In total, male cases constituted 50.3% (n = 582) and females constituted 49.7% (n = 574). The median age of the confirmed cases was 10.75 years (4.5-14.6). Of the total cases, 90 were younger than 1 year of age (7.8%), 108 were 1-3 years of age (9.3%), 148 were 3-6 years of age (12.8%), 298 were 6-12 years of age (25.8%), 233 were 12-15 years of age (20.2%), and 268 cases were older than 15 years of age (23.2%). The most common symptom of the patients at the first visit was fever (50.4%) (n = 583) for a median of 2 days (IQR: 1-3 days). Fever was median at 38.4 degrees C (38.0-38.7 degrees C). The second most common symptom was cough (n = 543, 46.9%). The other common symptoms were sore throat (n = 143, 12.4%), myalgia (n = 141, 12.2%), dyspnea (n = 118, 10.2%), diarrhea (n = 112, 9.7%), stomachache (n = 71, 6.1%), and nasal discharge (n = 63, 5.4%). When patients were classified according to disease severity, 263 (22.7%) patients were asymptomatic, 668 (57.7%) patients had mild disease, 209 (18.1%) had moderate disease, and 16 (1.5%) cases had severe disease. One hundred and forty-nine (12.9%) cases had underlying diseases among the total cases; 56% of the patients who had severe disease had an underlying condition (p < 0.01). The need for hospitalization did not differ between patients who had an underlying condition and those who do not have (p = 0.38), but the need for intensive care was higher in patients who had an underlying condition (p < 0.01). Forty-seven (31.5%) of the cases having underlying conditions had asthma or lung disease (38 of them had asthma). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the largest pediatric data about confirmed COVID-19 cases.

126,34053902,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Severe asthma management during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge and will continue to be, at least in the next few months, as herd immunity is still a mirage. A lot has to be learned about how COVID-19 affects underlying diseases, and severe asthma is no exception. METHODS: Narrative review of papers available until February 2021 in PubMed and Google Scholar, relating severe asthma and COVID-19. Four main research topics were reviewed: SARS-CoV-2 infection: immunology and respiratory pathology; interrelationship of severe asthma endotypes and COVID-19 disease mechanisms; severe asthma epidemiology and COVID-19; and biologics for severe asthma in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 disease mechanisms start with upper respiratory cell infection, and afterwards several immunological facets are activated, contributing to disease severity, namely cell-mediated immunity and antibody production. Although infrequent in the COVID-19 course some patients develop a cytokine storm that causes organ damage and may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiorgan failure. Regarding severe asthma endotypes, type2-high might have a protective role both in infection risk and disease course. There is conflicting data regarding the epidemiological relationship between COVID-19 among severe asthma patients, with some studies reporting increased risk of infection and disease course, whereas others the other way round. Biologics for severe asthma do not seem to increase the risk of infection and severe COVID-19, although further evidence is needed. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, in the era of COVID-19, major respiratory societies recommend continuing the biologic treatment, preferably in a self-home administration program.","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Severe asthma management during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge and will continue to be, at least in the next few months, as herd immunity is still a mirage.

127,34035996,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), causing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), has been responsible for approximately 75 million cases and 1.6 million deaths globally as of December 22, 2020. Currently, no treatment modalities or management options have been recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) prior to patient hospitalization and supplemental oxygen requirement. This poses a unique challenge for outpatient primary care physicians, who are often tasked with initial care of patients early on in their disease course. During the pandemic, our family practice provided medical care to approximately 2,000 families located in the surrounding Brooklyn community. With only telemedicine at our disposal, our clinic was tasked with treating patients presenting remotely who may or may not have had COVID-19 - a large clinical diagnosis was made given the absence of in-person testing. Often co-administered, Azithromycin was considered a supportive agent that may or may not have increased the benefit of hydroxychloroquine. However, Azithromycin may perform well on its own for various reasons as it has been shown to have antiviral activity against other RNA viruses, anti-inflammatory properties, and antiviral effects within bronchial epithelial cells. Azithromycin has also shown efficacy as an add-on treatment for reducing asthma exacerbations - pertinent to the pro-inflammatory pulmonary conditions in COVID-19 progression - and may even prevent or treat bacterial co-infection in patients with SARS-COV-2. In order to investigate the association between Azithromycin and the COVID-19 disease process, our clinical study retrospectively identified patients who were prescribed Azithromycin (500 mg on day one + 250 mg on days two to five) during the peak months of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City from March 2020 through May 2020. All patients prescribed Azithromycin with suspicion of COVID-19 infection were interviewed via telephone regarding their constellation of symptoms, compliance with the prescribed antibiotic for the intended course, symptom duration prior to and following antibiotic course initiation, as well as any further complications of their illness, if present. Ultimately, the majority of the patients who were interviewed over the phone concluded that a full course of Azithromycin helped improve their symptoms during their infection with COVID-19. Outcomes and complications in patients treated with Azithromycin were noteworthy in that there were no reports of pulmonary complications or deterioration of pulmonary function after treatment (e.g., no shortness of breath, wheezing, dyspnea, etc.), although some patients did experience residual coughing and nasal discharge post-treatment. We believe further study of this treatment in the setting of experimental, randomized controlled trials may reveal the benefits of Azithromycin in terms of reducing infection severity, length, and limiting the incidence of complications in patients with COVID-19.","The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), causing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), has been responsible for approximately 75 million cases and 1.6 million deaths globally as of December 22, 2020.

128,34034649,"BACKGROUND: Defining socio-demographic factors, clinical presentations and underlying diseases associated with COVID-19 severity could be helpful in its management. This study aimed to further clarify the determinants and clinical risk factors of the disease severity in patients infected with COVID-19. METHODS: A multi-centre descriptive study on all patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the province of Tehran from March 2020 up to Dec 2020 was conducted. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, comorbidities, and the health outcomes of 205,654 patients were examined. Characteristics of the study population were described. To assess the association of study variables with the disease severity, the Chi-Squared test and Multiple Logistic Regression model were applied. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 52.8 years and 93,612 (45.5%) were women. About half of the patients have presented with low levels of blood oxygen saturation. The ICU admission rate was 17.8% and the overall mortality rate was 10.0%. Older age, male sex, comorbidities including hypertension, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases other than asthma, chronic liver diseases, chronic kidney diseases, chronic neurological disorders, and HIV/AIDS infection were risk markers of poor health outcome. Clinical presentations related with worse prognosis included fever, difficulty breathing, impaired consciousness, and cutaneous manifestations. CONCLUSION: These results might alert physicians to pay attention to determinants and risk factors associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. In addition, our findings aid decision makers to emphasise on vulnerable groups in the public health strategies that aim at preventing the spread of the disease and its mortalities.","BACKGROUND: Defining socio-demographic factors, clinical presentations and underlying diseases associated with COVID-19 severity could be helpful in its management.

129,34019274,"Inflammation is a characteristic marker in numerous lung disorders. Several immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, eosinophils, as well as T and B lymphocytes, synthetize and release cytokines involved in the inflammatory process. Gender differences in the incidence and severity of inflammatory lung ailments including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis (PF), lung cancer (LC), and infectious related illnesses have been reported. Moreover, the effects of sex hormones on both androgens and estrogens, such as testosterone (TES) and 17beta-estradiol (E2), driving characteristic inflammatory patterns in those lung inflammatory diseases have been investigated. In general, androgens seem to display anti-inflammatory actions, whereas estrogens produce pro-inflammatory effects. For instance, androgens regulate negatively inflammation in asthma by targeting type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and T-helper (Th)-2 cells to attenuate interleukin (IL)-17A-mediated responses and leukotriene (LT) biosynthesis pathway. Estrogens may promote neutrophilic inflammation in subjects with asthma and COPD. Moreover, the activation of estrogen receptors might induce tumorigenesis. In this chapter, we summarize the most recent advances in the functional roles and associated signaling pathways of inflammatory cellular responses in asthma, COPD, PF, LC, and newly occurring COVID-19 disease. We also meticulously deliberate the influence of sex steroids on the development and progress of these common and severe lung diseases.","Inflammation is a characteristic marker in numerous lung disorders.

132,33976438,"OBJECTIVE: This analysis described the clinical features of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic in Ghana. METHODS: Data were extracted from two national COVID-19 treatment centers in Ghana for over 11 weeks(from March to May 2020). Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed. Modified Ordered Logistic and Negative Binomial Regression analysis were applied to establish factors associated with illness severity and Non-communicable Disease (NCDs) counts respectively. All analysis was conducted at the 95% confidence level (p-value </= 0.05) using Stata 16. RESULTS: Among the 275 patients, the average age was 40.7+/-16.4, with a preponderance of males (54.5%). The three commonest symptoms presented were cough (21.3%), headache (15.7%), and sore throat (11.7%). Only 7.6% of the patients had a history of fever. Most patients were asymptomatic (51.65). Approximately 38.9% have an underlying co-morbid NCDs, with Hypertension (32.1%), Diabetes (9.9%), and Asthma (5.2%) being the three commonest. The odds of Moderate/severe (MoS) was significantly higher for those with unknown exposures to similar illness [aOR(95%CI) = 4.27(1.12-10.2)] compared with non-exposure to similar illness. An increased unit of NCD's count significantly increased the odds of COVID-19 MoS illness by 26%[cOR(95%CI) =1.26(1.09-1.84)] and 67% (adjusting for age) [aOR(95%CI)=1.67(1.13-2.49)].

134,33968010,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected over 112M patients and resulted in almost 2.5M deaths worldwide. The major clinical feature of severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly associated with a cytokine storm. Objectives: To elucidate serum levels of TNF-alpha and soluble TNF-Receptor 1 (sTNFR1) in patients with severe and mild COVID-19 disease as determinants of disease severity. Methods: We determined serum TNF-alpha and sTNFR1 concentrations in 46 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (17 patients with severe disease within the intensive care unit [ICU] and 29 non-severe, non-ICU patients) and 15 healthy controls upon admission using ELISA. Subjects were recruited between March-May 2020 at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital Tehran, Iran. Results: Serum levels of sTNFRI were significantly higher in ICU patients (P<0.0001) and non-ICU patients (P=0.0342) compared with healthy subjects. Serum sTNFR1 were significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (P<0.0001). Serum TNF-alpha levels were greater in ICU and non-ICU patients than in the healthy subjects group (p<0.0001). The sTNFRI concentration in ICU (r=0.79, p=0.0002) and non-ICU (r=0.42, p=0.02) patients positively correlated with age although serum sTNFRI levels in ICU patients were significantly higher than in older healthy subjects. The sTNFRI concentration in ICU patients negatively correlated with ESR. Conclusions: The study demonstrates higher sTNFRI in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease and this be a biomarker of disease severity and mortality. Future studies should examine whether lower levels of systemic sTNFR1 at admission may indicate a better disease outcome.","Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected over 112M patients and resulted in almost 2.5M deaths worldwide.

Yet, the information provided by analyzing data from population-wide testing is critical to understand the infection dynamics and devise control strategies. We described clinical features and assessed antibody response in people screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We analyzed data from a cohort of 3464 people that we molecularly screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection in our routine activity. We recorded people SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, age, gender, blood types, white blood cells (WBC), symptoms, chronic disease status and time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR conversion from positive to negative. We calculated the age-based distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, analyzed the proportion and the spectrum of COVID-19 severity. Furthermore, in a nested sub-study, we screened 83 COVID-19 patients and 319 contact-cases for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Males and females accounted for respectively 51% and 49% of people screened. The studied population median and mean age were both 39 years. 592 out of 3464 people (17.2%) were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection with males and females representing, respectively, 53% and 47%. The median and mean ages of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects were 37 and 38 years respectively. The lowest rate of infection (8%) was observed in the elderly (aged > 60). The rate of SARS-Cov-2 infection in both young (18-35 years old) and middle-aged adults (36-60 years old) was around 20%. The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection age distribution showed that middle-aged adults accounted for 54.7% of SARS-CoV-2 positive persons, followed respectively by young adults (33.7%), children (7.7%) and elderly (3.8%). 68% (N = 402) of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons were asymptomatic, 26.3% (N = 156) had influenza-like symptoms, 2.7% (N = 16) had influenza-like symptoms associated with anosmia and ageusia, 2% (N = 11) had dyspnea and 1% (N = 7) had respiratory failure, which resulted in death. Data also showed that 12% of SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, had chronic diseases. Hypertension, diabetes, and asthma were the top concurrent chronic diseases representing respectively 58%, 25% and 12% of recorded chronic diseases. Half of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients were cured within 14 days following the initiation of the anti-COVID-19 treatment protocol. 78.3% of COVID-19 patients and 55% of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed negative contact-cases were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients with severe-to-critical illness have higher leukocytes, higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte counts contrarily to asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate illness. Neutrophilic leukopenia was more prevalent in asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate disease for 4 weeks after diagnosis (27.1-42.1%). In Patients with severe-to-critical illness, neutrophilic leukocytosis or neutrophilia (35.6-50%) and lymphocytopenia (20-40%) were more frequent. More than 60% of participants were blood type O. It is also important to note that infection rate was slightly higher among A and B blood types compared with type O. In this African setting, young and middle-aged adults are most likely driving community transmission of COVID-19. The rate of critical disease is relatively low.

Persistent questions remain about the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and comorbid diseases, as well as other chronic pulmonary conditions. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to examine in detail whether the underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), asthma and chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) were associated with an increased risk of more severe COVID-19. A comprehensive literature search was performed using five international search engines. In the initial search, 722 articles were identified. After eliminating duplicate records and further consideration of eligibility criteria, 53 studies with 658,073 patients were included in the final analysis.

140,33932179,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease whose symptoms and risk factors are newly described. Some allergic diseases, including asthma, have been defined as risk factors for a poor outcome in COVID-19. We aimed to investigate the role of another allergic disease-allergic rhinitis-in the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: This case-control study was conducted at Sakarya Educational and Research Hospital, Toyota Hospital and Yenikent State Hospital between March 18, 2020 and August 30, 2020. The study included a case group of 125 randomly selected patients who had been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis in advance of having COVID-19 and a control group of 125 patients without allergic rhinitis who were diagnosed with COVID-19. We evaluated all participants' statuses regarding smoking, symptoms, and hospitalization, as well as the length of their hospitalization and the number of their comorbidities. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding percentage of asymptomatic patients (p = 0.27), presence of smoking (p = 0.068), hospitalization status (p = 0.79), and hospitalization length (p = 0.55). From each group, two patients needed care in an intensive care unit (ICU). One patient from the case group and two from the control group died due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We found that allergic rhinitis did not affect the severity of COVID-19. However, we recommend that the literature be augmented with further studies on the COVID-19 prognosis of patients who have allergic rhinitis.","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease whose symptoms and risk factors are newly described.

141,33922634,"BACKGROUND: With the insurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people died in the past several months, and the situation is ongoing with increasing health, social, and economic panic and vulnerability. As most of the countries relying on different preventive actions to control the outcomes of COVID-19, it is necessary to boost the knowledge about the effectiveness of such actions so that the policymakers take their country-based appropriate actions. This study generates evidence of taking the most impactful actions to combat COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: In order to generate community-based scientific evidence, this study analyzed the outcome of COVID-19 in response to different control measures, healthcare facilities, life expectancy, and prevalent diseases. METHODS: It used more than a hundred countries' data collected from different databases. We performed a comparative graphical analysis with non-linear correlation estimation using R. RESULTS: The reduction of COVID-19 cases is strongly correlated with the earliness of preventive initiation. The apathy of taking nationwide immediate precaution measures has been identified as one of the critical reasons to make the circumstances worse. There is significant non-linear relationship between COVID-19 case fatality and number of physicians (NCC = 0.22; p-value </= 0.001), nurses and midwives (NCC = 0.17; p-value </= 0.001), hospital beds (NCC = 0.20; p-value </= 0.001), life expectancy of both sexes (NCC = 0.22; p-value </= 0.001), life expectancy of female (NCC = 0.27; p-value </= 0.001), and life expectancy of male (NCC = 0.19; p-value </= 0.001).

142,33883027,"BACKGROUND: The large airway epithelial barrier provides one of the first lines of defense against respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. Substantial inter-individual variability in individual disease courses is hypothesized to be partially mediated by the differential regulation of the genes that interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or are involved in the subsequent host response. Here, we comprehensively investigated non-genetic and genetic factors influencing COVID-19-relevant bronchial epithelial gene expression. METHODS: We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from bronchial epithelial brushings obtained from uninfected individuals. We related ACE2 gene expression to host and environmental factors in the SPIROMICS cohort of smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and replicated these associations in two asthma cohorts, SARP and MAST. To identify airway biology beyond ACE2 binding that may contribute to increased susceptibility, we used gene set enrichment analyses to determine if gene expression changes indicative of a suppressed airway immune response observed early in SARS-CoV-2 infection are also observed in association with host factors. To identify host genetic variants affecting COVID-19 susceptibility in SPIROMICS, we performed expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping and investigated the phenotypic associations of the eQTL variants. RESULTS: We found that ACE2 expression was higher in relation to active smoking, obesity, and hypertension that are known risk factors of COVID-19 severity, while an association with interferon-related inflammation was driven by the truncated, non-binding ACE2 isoform. We discovered that expression patterns of a suppressed airway immune response to early SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other viruses, are similar to patterns associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which may thus contribute to a COVID-19-susceptible airway environment. eQTL mapping identified regulatory variants for genes implicated in COVID-19, some of which had pheWAS evidence for their potential role in respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that clinically relevant variation in the expression of COVID-19-related genes is associated with host factors, environmental exposures, and likely host genetic variation.","BACKGROUND: The large airway epithelial barrier provides one of the first lines of defense against respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We included a cohort of patients with thyroid cancer with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 disease from 11 March to 30 May 2020 from the Turkish Ministry of Health database in our nationwide, retrospective study. We compared the mortality and morbidity of COVID patients with or without thyroid cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the independent factors for mortality, length of hospital stay and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation. We also analysed the effect of radioiodine treatment on severity and death rate of COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: We evaluated 388 COVID-19 patients with thyroid cancer [median age: 54 years, interquartile range (IQR) 18 years, males: 23%] and age and gender-matched 388 COVID-19 patients without thyroid cancer. Patients with thyroid cancer had a similar mortality ratio compared with the non-cancer group. Among patients with thyroid cancer, age, presence of diabetes mellitus, asthma/COPD, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, prior coronary artery disease, RAS blocker usage and low lymphocyte count were associated with mortality. Radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment and cumulative radioactive iodine dosage did not negatively affect the severity and mortality of COVID-19 disease in our patient group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that history of thyroid cancer did not have an increased risk of mortality or morbidity in COVID-19 disease. Besides, RAI therapy history and doses of radioactive iodine did not affect mortality or outcome.","BACKGROUND: There are scarce published data in differentiated thyroid cancer patients about new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease outcomes and mortality.

However, data on whether asthma constitutes a risk factor for COVID-19 and the prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 cases still remain scant. Here, we interrogated and analyzed the association between COVID-19 and asthma. METHODS: In this study, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for studies published between January 1 and August 28, 2020. We included studies that reported the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and its prevalence in asthma patients. We excluded reviews, animal trials, single case reports, small case series and studies evaluating other coronavirus-related illnesses. Raw data from the studies were pooled into a meta-analysis. RESULTS: We analyzed findings from 18 studies, including asthma patients with COVID-19. The pooled prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 cases was 0.08 (95% CI, 0.06-0.11), with an overall I(2) of 99.07%, p < 0.005.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive prospective study of ambulatory and hospitalized adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 attended between April 1 and May 31, 2020. Clinical features, chronic comorbidities and demographic data were recorded, and patients were followed for two months as outpatients. RESULTS: We assessed 1,022 adults aged 41 +/- 14 years (50% men) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. One-third had comorbidities, specially hypertension (12.5%), hypothyroidism (6.6%), asthma (5.4%) and diabetes (4.5%). Hospital admission was required in 11%, 5.2% were admitted to critical care unit and 0.9% were connected to mechanical ventilation. Common symptoms included fatigue (55.4%), fever (52.5%), headache (68.6%), anosmia/dysgeusia (53.2%), dry cough (53.4%), dyspnea (27.4%) and diarrhea (35.5%). One third of patients reported persistence of symptoms at one-month follow-up, specially fatigue, cough and dyspnea. In the multivariate analysis, age, fever, cough, dyspnea and immunosuppression were associated with hospitalization and ICU admission. Age, male sex and moderate-severe dyspnea were associated with requirement of mechanical ventilation. The main predictors of prolonged clinical course were female sex, presence of comorbidities, history of dyspnea, cough, myalgia and abdominal pain.

146,33821453,"PURPOSE: Chest X-ray (CXR) severity score and BMI-based obesity are predictive risk factors for COVID-19 hospital admission. However, the relationship between abdominal obesity and CXR severity score has not yet been fully explored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the association of different adiposity indexes, including waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), with CXR severity score in 215 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients with abdominal obesity showed significantly higher CXR severity scores and had higher rates of CXR severity scores >/= 8 compared to those without abdominal obesity (P < 0.001; P = 0.001, respectively). By contrast, patients with normal weight, with overweight and those with BMI-based obesity showed no significant differences in either CXR severity scores or in the rates of CXR severity scores >/= 8 (P = 0.104; P = 0.271, respectively). Waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) correlated more closely with CXR severity scores than BMI (r = 0.43, P < 0.001; r = 0.41, P < 0.001; r = 0.17, P = 0.012, respectively). The area under the curves (AUCs) for waist circumference and WHtR were significantly higher than that for BMI in identifying a high CXR severity score (>/= 8) (0.68 [0.60-0.75] and 0.67 [0.60-0.74] vs 0.58 [0.51-0.66], P = 0.001). A multivariate analysis indicated abdominal obesity (risk ratio: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.25-2.45, P < 0.001), bronchial asthma (risk ratio: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.07-2.81, P = 0.026) and oxygen saturation at admission (risk ratio: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.97, P < 0.001) as the only independent factors associated with high CXR severity scores. CONCLUSION: Abdominal obesity phenotype is associated with a high CXR severity score better than BMI-based obesity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

148,33774512,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate factors predicting severe symptomatic laboratory-confirmed (via Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR polymerase chain reaction) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection. STUDY DESIGN: This is a nationwide retrospective cohort study that was conducted in Mexico. METHODS: Data from 258 reinfection cases (at least 28 days between both episodes onset) were analyzed. We used risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate predictors of severe (dyspnea requiring hospital admission) secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The risk of severe disease was 14.7%, and the observed overall fatality rate was 4.3%. Patients with more serious primary disease were more likely to develop severe symptoms (39.5% vs. 5.5%, P < 0.001) during reinfection. In multiple analysis, factors associated with an increased risk of severe symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were increasing age (RRper year = 1.007, 95% CI = 1.003-1.010), comorbidities (namely, obesity [RR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.01-1.24], asthma [RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.06-1.50], type 2 diabetes mellitus [RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.07-1.38]), and previous severe laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.03-1.39).

149,33769313,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Data regarding the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on host-microbiome alteration and subsequent effects on susceptibility and clinical course of COVID-19, especially in atopic patients, are currently limited. Here, we review the studies regarding the microbiome of atopic patients with other respiratory infections and discuss the potential role of probiotics as therapeutic targets for COVID-19 to decrease its susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Respiratory tract virus infection affects the gut and airway microbiome structures and host's immune function. Diverse factors in atopic diseases affect the airway and gut microbiome structures, which are expected to negatively influence host health. However, response to respiratory virus infection in atopic hosts depends on the preexisting microbiome and immune responses. This may explain the inconclusiveness of the effects of COVID-19 on the susceptibility, morbidity, and mortality of patients with atopic diseases. Beneficial probiotics may be a therapeutic adjuvant in COVID-19 infection as the beneficial microbiome can decrease the viral load in the early phase of respiratory virus infection and improve the morbidity and mortality. SUMMARY: Application of probiotics can be a potential adjuvant treatment in respiratory virus infection to improve host immune responses and disturbed microbiome structures in atopic patients. Further related studies involving COVID-19 are warranted in near future.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Data regarding the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on host-microbiome alteration and subsequent effects on susceptibility and clinical course of COVID-19, especially in atopic patients, are currently limited.

Beneficial probiotics may be a therapeutic adjuvant in COVID-19 infection as the beneficial microbiome can decrease the viral load in the early phase of respiratory virus infection and improve the morbidity and mortality.

151,33754534,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has affected both adults and children with variable presentations and disease severity. Children can present with mild symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath, and rapidly progress to severe pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation. This population includes children who are younger than one year and older adolescents who have an underlying comorbidity-specifically immunosuppression or prior cardio-respiratory infections. In this review, we discuss the determinants of severe disease among the paediatric patients- primarily asthma, immune-status, obesity and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Asthma and underlying lung pathologies can be a strong predictor (~20% prevalence) for development of severe COVID-19 infection, irrespective of age. However, as compared to asthma, a higher mortality rate was reported in immune-compromised patients. With a weakened immune system, immunosuppressed individuals were 1.55 times and immunocompromised patients 3.29 times more vulnerable to developing severer COVID-19 disease. Similarly, evidence suggests that a BMI of greater than 35 kg/m2 renders individuals more susceptible to developing COVID-19-related complications. This observation is based on the negative impacts obesity has on pulmonary functions and in downplaying the immune system. Furthermore, a possible association of COVID-19 and MIS-C has been reported by multiple studies across the globe but it needs further studies to strengthen its stance due to the scarcity of data when compared with the other determinants discussed in this article. Authors recommend researchers directing attention on synthesizing the evolving evidence to fill the knowledge void in the paediatric population, which will better enable paediatricians to make informed decisions.","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has affected both adults and children with variable presentations and disease severity.

153,33727033,"BACKGROUND: Children have been less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, but its repercussions on pediatric illnesses may have been significant. This study examines the indirect impact of the pandemic on a population of critically ill children in the United States. RESEARCH QUESTION: Were there significantly fewer critically ill children admitted to PICUs during the second quarter of 2020, and were there significant changes in the types of diseases admitted? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study used the Virtual Pediatric Systems database. Participants were 160,295 children admitted to the PICU at 77 sites in the United States during quarters 1 (Q1) and 2 (Q2) of 2017 to 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and 2020 (COVID-19). RESULTS: The average number of admissions was similar between pre-COVID-19 Q1 and COVID-19 Q1 but decreased by 32% from pre-COVID-19 Q2 to COVID-19 Q2 (20,157 to 13,627 admissions per quarter). The largest decreases were in respiratory conditions, including asthma (1,327 subjects in pre-COVID-19 Q2 (6.6% of patients) vs 241 subjects in COVID-19 Q2 (1.8%; P < .001) and bronchiolitis (1,299 [6.5%] vs 121 [0.9%]; P < .001). The percentage of trauma admissions increased, although the raw number of trauma admissions decreased. Admissions for diabetes mellitus and poisoning/ingestion also increased. In the multivariable model, illness severity-adjusted odds of ICU mortality for PICU patients during COVID-19 Q2 increased compared with pre-COVID-19 Q2 (OR, 1.165; 95% CI, 1.00-1.357; P = .049). INTERPRETATION: Pediatric critical illness admissions decreased substantially during the second quarter of 2020, with significant changes in the types of diseases seen in PICUs in the United States.

157,33661877,"Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a potentially mortal disease characterized by a chronic pulmonary disease with persistent airway infection. Children with this disease are more susceptible to respiratory infections due to the limitation in mucociliary transport and anatomical disruption of the bronchial tree. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a respiratory illness related to exacerbations of chronic pulmonary pathologies in children, such as CF and asthma. There are not enough case reports on pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and CF, for which we share our experience. Case report: A 22-month-old male patient diagnosed with CF presented in the hospital with cough, fever, and increased respiratory work. The patient received supplemental oxygen and antibiotic and antiviral therapy. Positive results for type B influenza and RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained. Due to the persistence of respiratory difficulty, high-flow therapy was initiated, with a good response. After an episode of hypoxemia, bradycardia, and increased respiratory work secondary to accumulated secretions, orotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation were performed. The patient evolved with clinical and gasometric improvement. After 10 days of in-hospital antibiotic management with adequate clinical evolution, the patient was discharged to complete oral treatment and home isolation. Conclusions: We present a case of chronic respiratory disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection with severity criteria in a pediatric patient. The evolution was favorable with timely support management and antibiotic therapy in a third-level hospital.","Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a potentially mortal disease characterized by a chronic pulmonary disease with persistent airway infection.

Case report: A 22-month-old male patient diagnosed with CF presented in the hospital with cough, fever, and increased respiratory work. The patient received supplemental oxygen and antibiotic and antiviral therapy. Positive results for type B influenza and RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained. Due to the persistence of respiratory difficulty, high-flow therapy was initiated, with a good response. After an episode of hypoxemia, bradycardia, and increased respiratory work secondary to accumulated secretions, orotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation were performed. The patient evolved with clinical and gasometric improvement. After 10 days of in-hospital antibiotic management with adequate clinical evolution, the patient was discharged to complete oral treatment and home isolation.

158,33657264,"BACKGROUND: The lockdown imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a completely different style of life with possible effects on the attitude toward their disease in patients with chronic lung disease, such as asthma. The aim of our study was to investigate in asthmatic children the level of asthma control and the maintenance therapy used during the lockdown. METHODS: Among asthmatic children attending our clinic, we identified those who had been prescribed the same therapy in March-April 2019 and March-April 2020. The level of asthma control (GINA-score) and the maintenance therapy used during the lockdown (March-April 2020) were compared with those of March-April 2019. We separately analyzed a small group of children with severe asthma treated with Omalizumab during the lockdown. RESULTS: We enrolled 92 asthmatic children (67 males). Compared to 2019, in 2020 a higher proportion of children modified their maintenance therapy (38% vs. 15.2%, p < .001), with a significant increase in both the proportion of children who increased (p = .033) and in that of children who decreased their therapy (p = .026). The level of control resulted as significantly higher in 2020 (March p = .023; April p = .007). Also, the 13 children treated with Omalizumab showed a good level of control in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: In asthmatic children, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown had a significant impact on their asthma control and on their attitude toward maintenance therapy.","BACKGROUND: The lockdown imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a completely different style of life with possible effects on the attitude toward their disease in patients with chronic lung disease, such as asthma.

159,33650461,"OBJECTIVE: The evidence pertaining to the effects of asthma on Coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes has been unclear. To improve our understanding of the clinically important association of asthma and Coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: A matched cohort study was performed using data from the Mass General Brigham Health Care System (Boston, MA). Adult (age >/=18 years) patients with confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, or interstitial lung disease between March 4, 2020 and July 2, 2020 were analyzed. Up to five non-asthma comparators were matched to each asthma patient based on age (within 5 years), sex, and date of positive test (within 7 days). The primary outcomes were hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death, using multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models accounting for competing risk of death, when appropriate. Patients were followed for these outcomes from diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 until July 2, 2020. RESULTS: Among 562 asthma patients, 199 (21%) were hospitalized, 15 (3%) received mechanical ventilation, and 7 (1%) died. Among the 2686 matched comparators, 487 (18%) were hospitalized, 107 (4%) received mechanical ventilation, and 69 (3%) died. The adjusted Hazard Ratios among asthma patients were 0.99 (95% Confidence Internal 0.80, 1.22) for hospitalization, 0.69 (95% Confidence Internal 0.36, 1.29) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.30 (95% Confidence Internal 0.11, 0.80) for death.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the association between asthma diagnosis and endotype and clinical outcomes among patients diagnosed as having COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Retrospective multicenter cohort study of outpatients and inpatients presenting to 6 hospitals in the Mount Sinai Health System New York metropolitan region between March 7, 2020, and June 7, 2020, with COVID-19 infection, with and without a history of asthma. The primary outcome evaluated was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay. The outcomes were compared in patients with or without asthma using a multivariate Cox regression model. The outcomes stratified by blood eosinophilia count were also evaluated. RESULTS: Of 10,523 patients diagnosed as having COVID-19 infection, 4902 were hospitalized and 468 had a diagnosis of asthma (4.4%). When adjusted for COVID-19 disease severity, comorbidities, and concurrent therapies, patients with asthma had a lower mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.64 (0.53-0.77); P < .001) and a lower rate of hospitalization and intensive care unit admission (OR, 0.43 (0.28-0.64); P < .001 and OR, 0.51 (0.41-0.64); P < .001, respectively).

162,33639262,"BACKGROUND: Patients with asthma are comparatively susceptible to respiratory viral infections and more likely to develop severe symptoms than people without asthma. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is necessary to adequately evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of the population with asthma in the population tested for and diagnosed as having COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To perform a study to assess the impact of asthma on COVID-19 diagnosis, presenting symptoms, disease severity, and cytokine profiles. METHODS: This was an analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients suspected of having COVID-19 who presented for COVID-19 testing at a tertiary medical center in Missouri between March 2020 and September 2020. We classified and analyzed patients according to their pre-existing asthma diagnosis and subsequent COVID-19 testing results. RESULTS: Patients suspected of having COVID-19 (N = 435) were enrolled in this study. The proportions of patients testing positive for COVID-19 were 69.2% and 81.9% in the groups with asthma and without asthma, respectively. The frequencies of relevant symptoms were similar between the groups with asthma with positive and negative COVID-19 test results. In the population diagnosed as having COVID-19 (n = 343), asthma was not associated with several indicators of COVID-19 severity, including hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, death due to COVID-19, and in-hospital mortality after multivariate adjustment. Patients with COVID-19 with asthma exhibited significantly lower levels of plasma interleukin-8 than patients without asthma (adjusted P = .02). CONCLUSION: The population with asthma is facing a challenge in preliminary COVID-19 evaluation owing to an overlap in the symptoms of COVID-19 and asthma. However, asthma does not increase the risk of COVID-19 severity if infected.","BACKGROUND: Patients with asthma are comparatively susceptible to respiratory viral infections and more likely to develop severe symptoms than people without asthma.

We reviewed cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 in the pediatric age group. RECENT FINDINGS: Children infected by SARS-CoV-2 usually develop milder respiratory symptoms, but cutaneous manifestations seem a little more prevalent than in adults. These skin features of infection by the coronavirus can be similar to those produced by other common viruses, but there are also reports of cases with more heterogeneous clinical pictures, which have made their classification difficult. To date, the more frequently reported skin variants featured in pediatric cases are purpuric (pseudo-chilblain, necrotic-acral ischemia, hemorrhagic macules, and/or cutaneous necrosis), morbilliform/maculopapular, erythema multiforme, urticarial, vesicular, Kawasaki-like, and miscellaneous (highly variable in both frequency and severity). Their pathophysiological mechanism is still elusive and is likely to be the result of the complex involvement of one or more mechanisms, like direct virus-induced skin damage, vasculitis-like reactions, and/or indirect injury as a consequence of a systemic inflammatory reaction. In this review, we presented and discussed clinical cases as examples of different cutaneous responses reported in some children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, differential diagnosis considerations, and a preliminary conceptual approach to some of their probable associated pathologic mechanisms.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: At the juncture of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world is currently in an early phase of collecting clinical data and reports of its skin manifestations, and its pathophysiology is still highly conjectural.

OBJECTIVE: To distinguish active pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia and MIS-C using presenting signs and symptoms, patient characteristics, and laboratory values. DESIGN: Patients diagnosed and hospitalized with active COVID-19 pneumonia or MIS-C at Children's of Alabama Hospital in Birmingham, AL from April 1 through September 1, 2020 were identified retrospectively. Active COVID-19 and MIS-C cases were defined using diagnostic codes and verified for accuracy using current US Centers for Disease Control case definitions. All clinical notes were reviewed for documentation of COVID-19 pneumonia or MIS-C, and clinical notes and electronic medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, presenting signs and symptoms, prior exposure to or testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, laboratory data, imaging, treatment modalities and response to treatment. FINDINGS: 111 patients were identified, with 74 classified as mild COVID-19, 8 patients as moderate COVID-19, 8 patients as severe COVID-19, 10 as mild MIS-C and 11 as severe MIS-C. All groups had a male predominance, with Black and Hispanic patients overrepresented as compared to the demographics of Alabama. Most MIS-C patients were healthy at baseline, with most COVID-19 patients having at least one underlying illness. Fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms were predominant in the MIS-C population whereas COVID-19 patients presented with predominantly respiratory symptoms. The two groups were similar in duration of symptomatic prodrome and exposure history to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but MIS-C patients had a longer duration between presentation and exposure history. COVID-19 patients were more likely to have a positive SAR-CoV-2 PCR and to require respiratory support on admission. MIS-C patients had lower sodium levels, higher levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, d-dimer and procalcitonin. COVID-19 patients had higher lactate dehydrogenase levels on admission. MIS-C patients had coronary artery changes on echocardiography more often than COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study is one of the first to directly compare COVID-19 and MIS-C in the pediatric population. The significant differences found between symptoms at presentation, demographics, and laboratory findings will aide health-care providers in distinguishing the two disease entities.","IMPORTANCE: Active pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia and MIS-C are two disease processes requiring rapid diagnosis and different treatment protocols.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the immunological phenotype of patients are associated with duration of illness in patients with severe COVID-19. Method: In this single-center study, 69 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 were recruited retrospectively. Immunological parameters including counts of white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and levels of circulating cytokines and cytokine receptors were screened for their association with disease severity, survival and duration of illness of COVID-19. Results: Our data confirmed previous results that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and circulating levels of IL-6 represent prominent biomarker for the prediction of disease severity and survival of COVID-19. However, this study shows for the first time that duration of illness in patients with severe COVID-19 is positively associated with serum levels of IL-8 (P=0.004) and soluble IL-2Ralpha (P=0.025). Conclusion: The significant association of duration of illness with circulating levels of IL-8 and soluble IL-2Ralpha in patients with severe COVID-19 implicates that neutrophils and T cells are involved in the evolution of COVID-19.","Objectives: The coordinated immune response of the host is the key of the successful combat of the body against SARS-CoV-2 infection and is decisive for the development and progression of COVID-19.

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is disease severity measures and risk factors are associated with admission to an intensive care unit and mortality? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were extracted from the COVID-19 database of the Integrated Argentina Health Information System, encompassing the period of March 3rd to October 2nd, 2020, using a standardized case report form that included information on contact history, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical diagnosis. Information was collected at the initial site of care and follow-up conducted through calls by the regional healthcare authorities. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as having a positive result through sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. RESULTS: RT-PCR testing was positive in 738,776 cases. Complete datasets were available for analysis in 207,079 cases. Mean age was 42.9+/-18.8 years, 50.0% were males. Frequent co-existing conditions included hypertension (19.2%), diabetes (9.7%), asthma (6.1%) and obesity (5.2%). Most common symptoms included fever (58.5%), cough (58.0%), headache (45.4%), and sore throat (42.1%). Death or ICU admission were independently associated with older age, male, coma, dyspnea or tachypnea, and seizures, with underlying co-morbidities such as immunodeficiency, chronic renal failure, and liver disease showing the strongest effects. INTERPRETATION: Most cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Argentina were mild and had a favorable outcome, but fatality rates were relatively elevated. Risk factors for adverse outcome included older age, male sex, coma and seizures, and the concurrent presence of several morbidities. These data may be useful for healthcare providers and healthcare policy makers of low-middle income and Latin American countries to guide decisions toward optimized care during the pandemic.","BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Latin America.

169,33567446,"In this article, we propose that differences in COVID-19 morbidity may be associated with transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and/or transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) activation as well as desensitization. TRPA1 and TRPV1 induce inflammation and play a key role in the physiology of almost all organs. They may augment sensory or vagal nerve discharges to evoke pain and several symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, nasal obstruction, vomiting, diarrhea, and, at least partly, sudden and severe loss of smell and taste. TRPA1 can be activated by reactive oxygen species and may therefore be up-regulated in COVID-19. TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels can be activated by pungent compounds including many nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) (Nrf2)-interacting foods leading to channel desensitization. Interactions between Nrf2-associated nutrients and TRPA1/TRPV1 may be partly responsible for the severity of some of the COVID-19 symptoms. The regulation by Nrf2 of TRPA1/TRPV1 is still unclear, but suggested from very limited clinical evidence. In COVID-19, it is proposed that rapid desensitization of TRAP1/TRPV1 by some ingredients in foods could reduce symptom severity and provide new therapeutic strategies.","In this article, we propose that differences in COVID-19 morbidity may be associated with transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and/or transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) activation as well as desensitization.

172,33520082,"BACKGROUND: Data from the 2009 influenza pandemic suggested asthma might protect from severe disease in hospitalized patients. Asthma does not appear to increase risk for hospitalization or mortality with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to see if atopy actually protected those hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective chart review on all patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 over 2 months at a major adult and pediatric tertiary referral center hospital. Charts were evaluated for history of atopic disease, as were the need for ICU admission, requirement for supplemental oxygen and/or intubation, and in hospital mortality. RESULTS: No significant differences in outcomes for patients (n = 275) based on atopic disease were noted: ICU admission, 43% versus 44.7% (atopic versus no atopic disease, respectively; p = 0.84); supplemental oxygen use, 79.1% versus 73.6% (p = 0.36); intubation rate, 35.8% versus 36.5% (p = 0.92); and mortality rate, 13.4% versus 20.7% (p = 0.19). More patients with atopic disease had COPD listed as a diagnosis in their chart (38.8% versus 17.3%, p < 0.001). COPD was associated with an increased rate of ICU admission (aOR = 2.22 (1.15, 4.30) p = 0.02) and intubation (aOR = 2.05 (1.07, 3.92) p = 0.03). After adjusting for COPD, patients with atopic disease had a trend for reduced mortality (aOR 0.55 (0.23, 1.28), p = 0.16), but those with asthma did not (p > 0.2). CONCLUSION: Severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients does not differ based on atopic status.

More patients with atopic disease had COPD listed as a diagnosis in their chart (38.8% versus 17.3%, p < 0.001). COPD was associated with an increased rate of ICU admission (aOR = 2.22 (1.15, 4.30) p = 0.02) and intubation (aOR = 2.05 (1.07, 3.92) p = 0.03). After adjusting for COPD, patients with atopic disease had a trend for reduced mortality (aOR 0.55 (0.23, 1.28), p = 0.16), but those with asthma did not (p > 0.2). CONCLUSION: Severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients does not differ based on atopic status.

However, the impact on maternal mortality and whether morbidity is differentially affected by disease severity at delivery and trimester of infection are unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe disease severity and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pregnancy across the Washington State, including pregnancy complications and outcomes, hospitalization, and case fatality. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant patients with a polymerase chain reaction-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, were identified in a multicenter retrospective cohort study from 35 sites in Washington State. Sites captured 61% of annual state deliveries. Case-fatality rates in pregnancy were compared with coronavirus disease 2019 fatality rates in similarly aged adults in Washington State using rate ratios and rate differences. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared by trimester of infection and disease severity at the time of delivery. RESULTS: The principal study findings were as follows: (1) among 240 pregnant patients in Washington State with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections, 1 in 11 developed severe or critical disease, 1 in 10 were hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019, and 1 in 80 died; (2) the coronavirus disease 2019-associated hospitalization rate was 3.5-fold higher than in similarly aged adults in Washington State (10.0% vs 2.8%; rate ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-5.3); (3) pregnant patients hospitalized for a respiratory concern were more likely to have a comorbidity or underlying conditions including asthma, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune disease, and class III obesity; (4) 3 maternal deaths (1.3%) were attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 for a maternal mortality rate of 1250 of 100,000 pregnancies (95% confidence interval, 257-3653); (5) the coronavirus disease 2019 case fatality in pregnancy was a significant 13.6-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.7-43.6) higher in pregnant patients than in similarly aged individuals in Washington State with an absolute difference in mortality rate of 1.2% (95% confidence interval, -0.3 to 2.6); and (6) preterm birth was significantly higher among women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 at delivery than for women who had recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (45.4% severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 vs 5.2% mild coronavirus disease 2019; P<.001).

175,33495097,"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of information on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in asthmatics. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors associated with admission and subsequent mortality among COVID-19-infected asthmatics. METHODS: Adults at our institution with a positive polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 between March 14 and April 27, 2020, were retrospectively identified. Comorbidities, laboratory results, and mortality rates during hospitalization were recorded. RESULTS: In total, 737 of 951 (77.5%) asthma patients with COVID-19 were seen in the emergency department (ED), and 78.8% of these ED patients (581 of 737) were admitted. Individuals with previously measured mean absolute eosinophil counts (AEC) >/=150 cells/muL were less likely to be admitted (odds ratio [OR] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.98, P = .04), whereas concomitant heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were risk factors for admission. Hospitalized patients with asthma with peak hospital-measured AEC >/=150 cells/muL (n = 104) were less likely to die compared with those whose AEC remained <150 cells/muL (n = 213) (mortality rate 9.6% vs 25.8%; OR = 0.006, 95% CI: 0.0001-0.64, P = .03). This group had also higher preadmission mean AEC (237 +/- 181 vs 163 +/- 147 cells/muL, P = .001, OR = 2012, 95% CI: 27.3-14,816). The mortality rate in patients with asthma alone (no associated CHF, CKD, COPD, diabetes, or hypertension) was similar to that of patients without asthma or any of these comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: In asthmatics, pre-existing eosinophilia (AEC >/=150 cells/muL) was protective from COVID-19-associated admission, and development of eosinophilia (AEC >/=150 cells/muL) during hospitalization was associated with decreased mortality. Preadmission AEC influenced the AEC trend during hospitalization. Having a Th2-asthma phenotype might be an important predictor for reduced COVID-19 morbidity and mortality that should be further explored in prospective and mechanistic studies.","BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of information on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in asthmatics.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether allergic diseases are a risk factor for hospitalization in COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a study including 107 pediatric patients after COVID-19 recovery. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood Phase 3 questionnaires were distributed together with a detailed history of environmental factors and an allergic evaluation including skin prick tests, specific immunoglobulin E tests, and spirometry. We investigated the prevalence of allergic diseases and evaluated the factors associated with hospitalization in COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 61 (57%) patients were hospitalized and 46 (43%) patients were followed closely in the outpatient clinic. The prevalences of allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and episodic wheezing were 10.3%, 6,5%, 4.7%, and 3.7%, respectively, within the whole study population. Although having asthma with or without allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and passive tobacco exposure were not found to be related to hospitalization because of COVID-19, having a pet at home was found to decrease the risk of hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.191; 95% confidence interval, 0.047-0.779; P = .02). Spirometry tests revealed a higher forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity ratio and a peak expiratory flow reversibility in hospitalized patients than in nonhospitalized ones (P = .02 and P = .003, respectively). CONCLUSION: Asthma and allergic diseases do not seem to be risk factors for hospitalization in children because of COVID-19, and having a pet at home can be a protective effect.

179,33463114,"The emergence of a highly pathogenic virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) accounts for severe pneumonia throughout the world. More than 7 million world population have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the number of deaths is increasing every day. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients with an acute respiratory infection (ARI). During an outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2, the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 909 hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia, including 517 (56.9%) males and 392 (43.1%) females. All the collected samples were from different cities of Khuzestan province from 19 February to- 27 March 2020. The RNA was extracted from samples and subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2. Simultaneously, the computerized tomography (CT) scan was tested for the presence of ground-glass opacity in the lung among the patients. Of the total number of 909 specimens, 328 (36.08%) cases, including 185 (20.35%) females and 143 (15.73%) males, were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 while, 581 (63.9%) cases, including 374 (41.14%) males and 207 (22.77%) were negative for the SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR (p=0.001).Four hundred sixteen (45.76%) cases were positive for ground-glass opacity in the lung by CT scan, while 328/909 (36.08%) trials proved positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the real-time PCR (p=0.003). In this study, 36.08% of patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although the results of positive cases by CT scan showed higher than real-time PCR, screening the SARS-COV-2 with a real-time PCR method is the first line of choice.","The emergence of a highly pathogenic virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) accounts for severe pneumonia throughout the world.

181,33461602,"OBJECTIVES: Basic and clinical studies have shown that magnesium sulphate ameliorates lung injury and controls asthma attacks by anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory effects. Both intravenous and inhaled magnesium sulphate have a clinical impact on acute severe asthma by inhibition of airway smooth muscle contraction. Besides, magnesium sulphate can dilate constricted pulmonary arteries and reduce pulmonary artery resistance. However, it may affect systemic arteries when administered intravenously. A large number of patients with covid-19 admitted to the hospital suffer from pulmonary involvement. COVID-19 can cause hypoxia due to the involvement of the respiratory airways and parenchyma along with circulatory impairment, which induce ventilation-perfusion mismatch. This condition may result in hypoxemia and low arterial blood oxygen pressure and saturation presented with some degree of dyspnoea and shortness of breath. Inhaled magnesium sulphate as a smooth muscle relaxant (natural calcium antagonist) can cause both bronchodilator and consequently vasodilator effects (via a direct effect on alveolar arterioles in well-ventilated areas) in the respiratory tract. We aim to investigate if inhaled magnesium sulphate as adjuvant therapy to standard treatment can reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatch in the respiratory tract and subsequently improve arterial oxygen saturation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: A multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel arms design (1:1 ratio) PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18-80 years hospitalized at Masih Daneshvari Hospital and Shahid Dr. Labbafinejad hospital in Tehran and Shahid Sadoughi Hospital in Yazd will be included if they meet the inclusion criteria of the study. Inclusion criteria are defined as 1. Confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal secretions or clinical manifestations along with chest computed tomography (chest CT) scan 2. Presenting with moderate or severe COVID-19 lung involvement confirmed with chest CT scan and arterial oxygen saturation below 93% 3. Length of hospital stay </=48 hours. Patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases including congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmia, heart block, the myocardial injury will be excluded from the study. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomly divided into two arms. Patients in the intervention arm will be given both standard treatment for COVID-19 (according to the national guideline) and magnesium sulphate (5 cc of a 20% injectable vial or 2 cc of a 50% injectable vial will be diluted by 50 cc distilled water and nebulized via a mask) every eight hours for five days. Patients in the control (comparator) arm will only receive standard treatment for COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES: Improvement of respiratory function and symptoms including arterial blood oxygen saturation, dyspnoea (according to NYHA functional classification), and cough within the first five days of randomization. RANDOMISATION: Block randomisation will be used to allocate eligible patients to the study arms (in a 1:1 ratio). Computer software will be applied to randomly select the blocks. BLINDING (MASKING): The study is an open-label RCT without blinding. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The trial will be performed on 100 patients who will be randomly divided into two arms of control (50) and intervention (50).

SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction. General characteristics and chronic comorbidities were explored. Clinical outcomes of interest were hospital admission, pneumonia, intensive care unit admission, endotracheal intubation and mortality. Prevalence of chronic comorbidities was 49.4%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the effect of age, male sex, bronchial asthma, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease on clinical outcomes was similar for both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. Adverse clinical outcomes were associated with the time from symptoms onset to medical contact, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and obesity in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, but with cardiovascular disease in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (p value < 0.01 for all comparisons). Chronic comorbidities are commonly found in patients with suspicion of viral respiratory disease.

Although the knowledge base surrounding COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 has grown rapidly, significant gaps in our knowledge remain and inaccurate information continues to circulate. This review will discuss the interaction between asthma and COVID-19 to provide a comprehensive understanding based on the currently available published data. RECENT FINDINGS: Non-SARS human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are a significant cause of asthma exacerbations, but SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to exacerbate asthma. Data thus far strongly suggest that patients with asthma are at no increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 or more severe disease if infected with COVID-19. Although the data are extremely limited on inhaled corticosteroids and biologic medications, there remain no data suggesting that these therapeutics positively or negatively impact the severity or outcome of COVID-19. SUMMARY: Data are rapidly evolving regarding COVID-19 and asthma. At this time, asthma does not appear to positively or negatively affect outcomes of COVID-19; however, it is imperative that practitioners keep abreast of the changing literature as we await a vaccine and control of this pandemic.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In December 2019, a novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first described and named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

190,33385710,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is considered the most critical health pandemic of 21st century. Due to extremely high transmission rate, people are more susceptible to viral infection. COVID-19 patients having chronic type-2 asthma prevails a major risk as it may aggravate the disease and morbidities. OBJECTIVE: The present review mainly focuses on correlating the influence of COVID-19 in type-2 asthmatic patients. Besides, it delineates the treatment measures and drugs that can be used to manage mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID-19 in asthmatic patients, thus preventing any exacerbation. METHODS: An in-depth research was carried out from different peer-reviewed articles till September 2020 from several renowned databases like PubMed, Frontier, MEDLINE, and related websites like WHO, CDC, MOHFW, and the information was analysed and written in a simplified manner. RESULTS: The progressive results were quite conflicting as severe cases of COVID-19 shows an increase in the level of several cytokines that can augment inflammation to the bronchial tracts, worsening the asthma attacks. Contradicting to this, certain findings reveal the decrease in the severity of COVID-19 due to the elevation of T-cells in type-2 asthmatic patients, as prominent reduction of T-cell is seen in most of the COVID-19 positive patients. This helps to counteract the balance of immune responses and hence ameliorate the disease progression. CONCLUSION: Asthmatic patients must remain cautious during the COVID-19 pandemic by maintaining all the precautions to stay safe due to limited research data. Future strategies should include a better understanding of asthmatic exacerbation and its relation to COVID-19.","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is considered the most critical health pandemic of 21st century.

191,33378278,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently one of the most important public health crises affecting the global human population. It continues to spread widely, as the world still lacks specific treatments and a vaccine for the virus. The scenario of COVID-19 in Yemen seems obscure due to the lack of adequate data, therefore, we developed an electronic questionnaire and distributed it online among Yemeni people. The aim of this study was to understand the COVID-19 epidemiological situation in Yemen better since there is currently limited published data and limited availability of COVID-19 testing. METHODOLOGY: A 34-question web-based survey was distributed on social media outlets targeting people in Yemen. Data aggregation, analysis, and visualization were performed using Tableau and Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: 2,341 individuals reported symptoms concerning for COVID-19 infection, with 25.4% reporting a chronic medical condition. Diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and immune deficiency were associated with increased severity of the disease, while obesity, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and liver disease were not. Only 37 individuals (1.6%) had a confirmatory COVID-19 PCR test. The presence of high fever, dyspnea, chest pain, and dysphagia were symptoms that tended to be correlated to worse clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some important information about the early overspread of COVID-19 within the Yemeni community in May, June, and July of 2020. It shows that online questionnaires may help in collecting data about pandemics in resource-limited countries where testing availability is limited.","INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently one of the most important public health crises affecting the global human population.

192,33372930,"INTRODUCTION: Obesity, diabetes, hypertension and age have been pointed at as factors that influence on the progression of COVID-19; however, evidence for other conditions is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To identify which clinical characteristics are related to COVID-19 severity and to determine whether age acts a modifier of the relationship between cardio-metabolic comorbidities (CMC) and COVID-19 progression.

Hospitalization, development of pneumonia, intubation requirement, intensive care unit admission and death were the dependent variables in Poisson regression models estimation, whereas the interaction between age and different CMCs were the independent variables. RESULTS: Having CMCs, as well as other comorbidities, was directly related to COVID-19 progression, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was only related to an increase in the risk of dying.

193,33368332,"Diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) cases is based on the count of real-time reverse transcription-plymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive people. Viral load by real-time RT-PCR has been suggested as a biomarker of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the association of viral load and severity of the disease is not yet resolved. Nasopharyngeal samples from 458 patients were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Relative quantitation was made by the comparative threshold cycle (DeltaDeltaCt ) formula between ORF1ab viral and RNase P housekeeping genes. Absolute viral load was calculate using a reference positive control. Most prevalent clinical signs were cough (75.8%), myalgia (66.7%), and fever (48.5%). Hypertension (18.2%), neurological diseases (15.1%), and asthma and hypothyroidism (12.1%) were most frequent comorbidities. Fever, either as an exclusive symptom or combined with others, was associated with high viral loads ( 2 - C t range, 35.65-155.16; 4.25-4.89 log10 RNA copies/test]). During the first week after onset of symptoms in mild patients up to 60 years-old was detected the peak of viral load. Children under 10 years old have a high viral load (313.84; 2.50) in the first 2 days postinfection with a sharp decline thereafter. Cases between 10 and 49 years old mostly showed low and moderate viral load during the first 2 days postinfection (range, 0.03 to 17.24; -1.50 to 1.24). Patients over 60 years old have high viral load up to the second week after the onset of symptoms (range, 25.32-155.42; 1.40-2.19), indicating the longer presence of the virus in them.

194,33352565,"There are large country variations in COVID-19 death rates that may be partly explained by diet. Many countries with low COVID-19 death rates have a common feature of eating large quantities of fermented vegetables such as cabbage and, in some continents, various spices. Fermented vegetables and spices are agonists of the antioxidant transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), and spices are transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 and vanillin 1 (TRPA1/V1) agonists. These mechanisms may explain many COVID-19 symptoms and severity. It appears that there is a synergy between Nrf2 and TRPA1/V1 foods that may explain the role of diet in COVID-19. One of the mechanisms of COVID-19 appears to be an oxygen species (ROS)-mediated process in synergy with TRP channels, modulated by Nrf2 pathways. Spicy foods are likely to desensitize TRP channels and act in synergy with exogenous antioxidants that activate the Nrf2 pathway.","There are large country variations in COVID-19 death rates that may be partly explained by diet.

195,33349845,"BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with COVID-19 infection is uncertain. We derived and validated a new risk model for predicting progression to disease severity, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection (Gal-COVID-19 scores). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in Galicia, Spain. Data were extracted from electronic health records of patients, including age, sex and comorbidities according to International Classification of Primary Care codes (ICPC-2). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the probability of disease severity. Calibration and discrimination were evaluated to assess model performance. RESULTS: The incidence of infection was 0.39% (10 454 patients). A total of 2492 patients (23.8%) required hospitalization, 284 (2.7%) were admitted to the ICU and 544 (5.2%) died. The variables included in the models to predict severity included age, gender and chronic comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, liver disease, chronic kidney disease and haematological cancer. The models demonstrated a fair-good fit for predicting hospitalization {AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve] 0.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76, 0.78]}, admission to ICU [AUC 0.83 (95%CI 0.81, 0.85)] and death [AUC 0.89 (95%CI 0.88, 0.90)]. CONCLUSIONS: The Gal-COVID-19 scores provide risk estimates for predicting severity in COVID-19 patients. The ability to predict disease severity may help clinicians prioritize high-risk patients and facilitate the decision making of health authorities.","BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with COVID-19 infection is uncertain.

196,33332437,"BACKGROUND: A worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), since 2019, has brought a disaster to people all over the world. Many researchers carried out clinical epidemiological studies on patients with COVID-19 previously, but risk factors for patients with different levels of severity are still unclear. METHODS: 562 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 12 hospitals in China were included in this retrospective study. Related clinical information, therapies, and imaging data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between patients with severe and non-severe status. We explored the risk factors associated with different severity of COVID-19 patients by logistic regression methods. RESULTS: Based on the guideline we cited, 509 patients were classified as non-severe and 53 were severe. The age range of whom was 5-87 years, with a median age of 47 (IQR 35.0-57.0). And the elderly patients (older than 60 years old) in non-severe group were more likely to suffer from fever and asthma, accompanied by higher level of D-dimer, red blood cell distribution width and low-density lipoprotein. Furthermore, we found that the liver and kidney function of male patients was worse than that of female patients in both severe and non-severe groups with different age levels, while the severe females had faster ESR and lower inflammatory markers. Of major laboratory markers in non-severe cases, baseline albumin and the lymphocyte percentage were higher, while the white blood cell and the neutrophil count were lower. In addition, severe patients were more likely to be accompanied by an increase in cystatin C, mean hemoglobin level and a decrease in oxygen saturation. Besides that, advanced age and indicators such as count of white blood cell, glucose were proved to be the most common risk factors preventing COVID-19 patients from aggravating. CONCLUSION: The potential risk factors found in our study have shown great significance to prevent COVID-19 patients from aggravating and turning to critical cases during treatment. Meanwhile, focusing on gender and age factors in groups with different severity of COVID-19, and paying more attention to specific clinical symptoms and characteristics, could improve efficacy of personalized intervention to treat COVID-19 effectively.","BACKGROUND: A worldwide outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), since 2019, has brought a disaster to people all over the world.

198,33309934,"BACKGROUND: The impact of asthma on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the asthma prevalence among patients with COVID-19 and compare outcomes between patients with and without asthma. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, bioRxiv, and medRxiv for studies reporting asthma prevalence in general patients with COVID-19 or comparing outcomes between patients with and without asthma, and excluded duplicate publications, reviews, editorials, comments, single case reports, or small case series (<10 cases).

200,33276252,"BACKGROUND: The effects of chronic inhaled and systemic corticosteroids use on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity are unclear. Since many patients with chronic pulmonary diseases rely on corticosteroids to control disease, it is important to understand the risks of their use during the pandemic. We aim to study if the use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids affects the likelihood of developing COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We used the National Jewish Health electronic medical record research database to identify a cohort of all subjects who were tested for suspected COVID-19 between March 11 - June 23, 2020. Testing results, medication use, and comorbidities were obtained from the medical record. Following a comparison of different propensity score weighting methods, overlap propensity score weighting was used to analyze the association between medication use and COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 928 patients, of which 12% tested positive. The majority (66%) of patients had a history of chronic pulmonary diseases. There was no significant association between inhaled corticosteroid use and testing positive for COVID-19. Interestingly, systemic corticosteroid use was associated with a lower odds ratio (0.95, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99) of testing positive for COVID-19. Similar results were noted when the analysis was restricted to those with any chronic pulmonary diseases, with asthma or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the recommendation that patients with chronic pulmonary diseases, including asthma and COPD who require treatment with either inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, should continue their use during the COVID-19 pandemic.","BACKGROUND: The effects of chronic inhaled and systemic corticosteroids use on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity are unclear.

202,33263697,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical manifestations and severity of children and adolescents affected by COVID-19 treated at Sabara Hospital Infantil. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, retrospective, and observational study. All cases of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-qPCR of patients seen at the hospital (emergency room, first-aid room, and ICU) were analyzed. The severity of the cases was classified according to the Chinese Consensus. RESULTS: Among the 115 children included, a predominance of boys (57%) was verified, and the median age was two years. A total of 22 children were hospitalized, 12 in the ICU. Of the total, 26% had comorbidities with a predominance of asthma (13%). Fever, cough, and nasal discharge were the most frequent symptoms. Respiratory symptoms were reported by 58% of children and gastrointestinal symptoms, by 34%. Three children were asymptomatic, 81 (70%) had upper airway symptoms, 15 (13%) had mild pneumonia, and 16 (14%) had severe pneumonia. Hospitalized children were younger than non-hospitalized children (7 months vs. 36 months). In hospitalized patients, a higher frequency of irritability, dyspnea, drowsiness, respiratory distress, low oxygen saturation, and hepatomegaly was observed. Chest radiography was performed in 69 children with 45% of abnormal exams. No child required mechanical ventilation and there were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Most of children and adolescents affected by COVID-19 had mild upper airway symptoms.

203,33259989,"BACKGROUND: Scant data are currently available about a potential link between comorbid chronic lung diseases (CLD) and the risk and severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS: To describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes for patients with COVID-19 infection, including patients with comorbid respiratory diseases, who have been primarily hospitalized in the pulmonology department of Strasbourg University Hospital, France. In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 3 to April 15, 2020. We then compared the symptoms, biological and radiological findings, and outcomes for patients with and without CLD. RESULTS: Of the 124 patients that were enrolled, the median age was 62 years, and 75 patients (60%) were male. Overall, 40% of patients (n=50) had preexisting CLD, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n=15, 12%) and asthma (n=19, 15%).

CLD were not predictive of ICU hospitalization, but a significantly higher total mortality was observed (17.6% vs. 5.5%, P<0.05) in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the lack of an over-representation of CLD in COVID-19, representing 40% of patients in this cohort and even within a pulmonology department. CLD were not a risk factor for ICU management. However, a tendency to higher global mortality was observed in COVID-19 patients with CLD.

204,33253975,"INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affecting the lungs. All tobacco-related illnesses including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease are known to reduce the lung capacity and impair the immune system of the body and can greatly influence the ability to fight the novel coronavirus. The purpose of this state-of-the-art literature review is to summarize the evidence of the association of tobacco use with the severity of the COVID-19 manifestations. METHOD: Articles describing the association of tobacco use with the severity of COVID-19 manifestations were searched on PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google. This review covers the relevant studies on the subject published from January 1, 2020 to September 10, 2020. RESULTS: Tobacco use in all forms, whether smoking or chewing, is significantly associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. Pre-existing comorbidities in tobacco users such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases and hypertension were found to further aggravate the disease manifestations making the treatment of such COVID-19 patients more challenging due to their rapid clinical deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: Current review indicates that nicotine exposure is linked to cardiopulmonary vulnerability to COVID-19 and tobacco use can be a potential risk factor for not only getting the viral infection but also its severe manifestations. The current pandemic provides a teachable moment to break the cycle of nicotine addiction and accelerate national tobacco control programs to achieve a tobacco-free world.","INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affecting the lungs.

PURPOSE: In this study, we tried to determine the frequency of allergic diseases in COVID-19 patients and the effect of having an allergic disease on COVID-19 disease severity. DESIGN/METHOD: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in a state hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Patients were contacted by phone and those who approved to participate in the study were questioned about their sociodemographic characteristics, body mass index, smoking history, and about their atopic status. Rate of atopic diseases among mild and severe COVID-19 patients and risk estimates for mild disease in atopic and non-atopic COVID-19 patients were calculated. RESULTS: Study population consisted of 235 adults with COVID-19 (mean age, 45.3 years [standard deviation, 15.0 years]; 139 [59.1%] male).

Pre-existing comorbidities have been found to have a dramatic effect on the disease course. We sought to analyze the effect of asthma on the disease progression and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a multi-center retrospective study of positively confirmed COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 502 COVID-19 adult patients (72 asthma and 430 non-asthma cohorts) with mean age of 60.7 years were included in the study. The frequency of asthma in hospitalized cohorts was 14.3%. Univariate analysis revealed that asthma patients were more likely to be obese (75% versus 54.2%, p = 0.001), with a higher frequency of intubation (40.3% versus 27.8%, p = 0.036), and required a longer duration of hospitalization (15.1 +/- 12.5 versus 11.5 +/- 10.6, p = 0.015). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that asthmatic patients were not associated with higher risk of ICU admission (OR = 1.81, 95%CI = 0.98-3.09, p = 0.06), endotracheal intubation (OR = 1.77, 95%CI = 0.99-3.04, p = 0.06) or complications (OR = 1.37, 95%CI = 0.82-2.31, p = 0.23).

The present study focuses on the demographic, clinical and laboratory profile of such patients from a tertiary level non-COVID respiratory care hospital. This is a retrospective observational study. Seventy-seven sick patients fulfilling COVID suspect criteria were admitted to the isolation area. Their RT-PCR test was done from the designated laboratory and 35 of them were confirmed to be COVID-19 patients. The detailed demographic, clinical and laboratory profile of these COVID-19 patients was studied. The mean age was 46+/-17 years with male predominance (57%). Majority of the cases (83%) were symptomatic. The most common symptom was cough (66%) followed by breathlessness and fever. Nineteen (54.3%) patients had one or the other co-morbidity and 16 (45.7%) had chronic lung diseases as one of the comorbidities. Nearly half of the patients (51%) required supplementary oxygen on presentation. Two patients were put on invasive mechanical ventilation while 4 patients required non-invasive ventilation before being shifted to the COVID hospital. Hence, it can be concluded that COVID-19 in patients of chronic respiratory diseases manifests with higher prevalence of symptoms and also higher severity of disease. Further, the symptomatology of COVID-19 closely mimics the acute exacerbation of chronic lung diseases, so cautious screening and testing should be done, especially at the pulmonary department.","The pandemic of COVID-19 has emerged as a serious health crisis globally and India too has been extensively affected with 604,641 active cases reported, till date.

215,33154029,"BACKGROUND: An association between the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the presence of certain chronic conditions has been suggested. However, unlike influenza and other viruses, the disease burden of COVID-19 in patients with asthma has been less evident. OBJECTIVE: To understand the impact of COVID-19 in patients with asthma. METHODS: Using big-data analytics and artificial intelligence through the SAVANA Manager clinical platform, we analysed clinical data from patients with asthma from January 1 to May 10, 2020. RESULTS: Out of 71 182 patients with asthma, 1006 (1.41%) suffered from COVID-19. Compared to asthmatic individuals without COVID-19, patients with asthma and COVID-19 were significantly older (55 versus 42 years), predominantly female (66% versus 59%), smoked more frequently and had higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidaemias, diabetes and obesity. Allergy-related factors such as rhinitis and eczema were less common in asthmatic patients with COVID-19 (p<0.001). In addition, higher prevalence of these comorbidities was observed in patients with COVID-19 who required hospital admission. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was lower in patients who required hospitalisation due to COVID-19, as compared to non-hospitalised patients (48.3% versus 61.5%; OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.44-0.77). Although patients treated with biologics (n=865; 1.21%) showed increased severity and more comorbidities at the ear, nose and throat level, COVID-19-related hospitalisations in these patients were relatively low (0.23%). CONCLUSION: Patients with asthma and COVID-19 were older and at increased risk due to comorbidity-related factors.

Thus, it is unclear whether pre-existing CVDs are independently important predictors for severe COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a nationwide Danish cohort of hospital-screened COVID-19 patients aged >/=40, we investigated if pre-existing CVDs predict the 30-day risk of (i) composite outcome of severe COVID-19 and (ii) all-cause mortality. We estimated 30-day risks using a Cox regression model including age, sex, each CVD comorbidity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-asthma, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. To illustrate CVD comorbidities' importance, we evaluated the predicted risks of death and severe infection, for each sex, along ages 40-85. In total, 4090 COVID-19 hospital-screened patients were observed as of 26 August 2020; 22.1% had >/=1 CVD, 23.7% had severe infection within 30 days and 12.6% died. Predicted risks of both outcomes at age 75 among men with single CVD comorbidities did not differ in clinically meaningful amounts compared with men with no comorbidities risks for the composite outcome of severe infection; women with heart failure (28.2%; 95% CI 21.1-37.0%) or atrial fibrillation (30.0%; 95% CI: 24.2-36.9%) showed modest increases compared with women with no comorbidities (24.0%; 95% CI: 21.4-26.9%).

The patients included in the study were randomly selected from the registration system and their information was evaluated retrospectively. The mean age of the patients was 54.42 (Age range= 20-90). When the risk factors for catching the disease were evaluated; it was determined that there was at least one risk factor in 46 patients; 30 patients had close contact with the COVID-19 patient in the social environment (30%) and 16 patients had a travel history outside the city in the last 14 days (16%). The most common symptoms in our patients were; cough (93%), fever (42%), dyspnea (22%), weakness (8%), sore throat (7%), diarrhea (6%), headache (5%) and sputum (2%).

When these two groups were compared in terms of comorbid diseases, the presence of DM was 40% higher (n= 6) in intensive care patients, and this difference was statistically significant (p= 0.05). In addition, the majority [11 patients (73%)] of the patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit were male (p= 0.03). When smoking was evaluated as a risk factor for serious illness, 4 of 11 patients (26%) in intensive care unit had a smoking history, while none of the patients who have died due to COVID-19 had a smoking history. These findings suggested to us that smoking does not increase the severity of COVID-19 disease. As a result, knowledge about the disease should be increased rapidly by sharing the studies on risk factors, transmission routes and clinical features of COVID-19 infection, which affects the whole world.","Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that can cause disease in the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans and animals.

220,33091758,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health emergency. According to the findings, male patients with COVID-19 infection are at an increased risk for severe complications than females. The causes of this issue are unknown and are most probably multifactorial. Sexual hormones affect the immune system, so estrogen strengthens the immune system, and testosterone suppresses it. Due to the reports of the high prevalence of androgenic alopecia in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a higher risk of respiratory disease and increased use of allergy/asthma medications among patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as a hyperandrogenism condition compared with non-PCOS women, this review aimed to evaluate androgens role in COVID-19. METHODS: 42 related articles from 2008 to 2020 were reviewed with the keywords of androgens, hormonal factors, and hair loss in combination with COVID-19 in medical research databases. RESULTS: The evidence of transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) expression in lung tissue, which is an androgen-regulated gene and expressed mainly in the adult prostate may interpret the increased susceptibility of the male gender to severe COVID-19 complications. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) acts as a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and male hormones are effective in the ACE-2 passageway and simplify SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. CONCLUSION: Further studies on the severity of symptoms in patients with COVID-19 in other hyperandrogenism conditions compared to the control group are recommended.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health emergency.

222,33066495,"Infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of a new disease (COVID-19). The risk of severe COVID-19 is increased by certain underlying comorbidities, including asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Notably, exposure to hormonally active chemicals called endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can promote such cardio-metabolic diseases, endocrine-related cancers, and immune system dysregulation and thus, may also be linked to higher risk of severe COVID-19. Bisphenol A (BPA) is among the most common EDCs and exerts its effects via receptors which are widely distributed in human tissues, including nuclear oestrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta), membrane-bound oestrogen receptor (G protein-coupled receptor 30; GPR30), and human nuclear receptor oestrogen-related receptor gamma. As such, this paper focuses on the potential role of BPA in promoting comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19, as well as on potential BPA-induced effects on key SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Interestingly, GPR30 appears to exhibit greater co-localisation with TMPRSS2 in key tissues like lung and prostate, suggesting that BPA exposure may impact on the local expression of these SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators. Overall, the potential role of BPA on the risk and severity of COVID-19 merits further investigation.","Infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of a new disease (COVID-19).

223,33065600,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of over 20 zinc-dependent proteases with different biological and pathological activities, and many have been implicated in several diseases. Although nonselective MMP inhibitors are known to induce serious side-effects, targeting individual MMPs may offer a safer therapeutic potential for several diseases. Hence, we provide a concise overview on MMP-12, given its association with pulmonary diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and other progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF), which may also occur in coronavirus disease 2019. RECENT FINDINGS: In asthma, COPD, and PPF, increased MMP-12 levels have been associated with inflammation and/or structural changes within the lungs and negatively correlated with functional parameters. Increased pulmonary MMP-12 levels and MMP-12 gene expression have been related to disease severity in asthma and COPD. Targeting MMP-12 showed potential in animal models of pulmonary diseases but human data are still very scarce. SUMMARY: Although there may be a potential role of MMP-12 in asthma, COPD and PPF, several pathophysiological aspects await elucidation.

226,33044171,"PURPOSE: It has come to our attention that specific vascular changes (VCs) appear more frequently in chest computed tomography (CT) of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we aimed to investigate if these specific VCs in chest CT correlate with clinical severity of the disease. METHODS: CT images of 102 patients who underwent low-dose noncontrast chest CT due to COVID-19 between 11 March 2020 and 11 April 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of VCs in CT images. VCs in chest CT of patients with COVID-19 were defined using the following descriptors: decreased lumen caliber, vascular wall irregularity, angulation in the course of the vessel, vascular disruption, and/or interruption. The relationship of these VCs with disease symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath), comorbid conditions (diabetes, hypertension, asthma), smoking habit, disease-specific laboratory changes (white blood cell-lymphocyte count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein [CRP], D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ferritin, procalcitonin), lung parenchymal infiltration pattern (ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation) and its distribution (peripheral, central, mixed, upper lobes, lower lobes, right middle lobe) on CT were investigated by comparison of these variables between patients with and without VCs in chest CT. RESULTS: VCs were observed in 18 out of 102 patients (18%) with typical parenchymal involvement for COVID-19. There was no significant difference in terms of age and sex. We found an irregularity in the wall of the vascular structures in the distal branches and decreased lumen caliber of the vessels related to ground-glass opacities in 15 patients, concentric luminal narrowing in annular form in 4 patients, angulation/traction or springiness in the vascular structures towards the active lesions in 3 patients, and interruptions along the vascular course in 1 patient. VCs were significantly correlated with fever (12/18, 66.7%) and shortness of breath (7/18, 39%). These changes were significantly more remarkable in common disease involving both upper and lower lobes (10/18, 56%). In these cases, there was a substantial increase in CRP (15/18, 83%; mean, 5.7+/-6.3 mg/dL) and LDH (8/18, 44%) values compared to those who did not have any VCs. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that specific VCs observed in chest CT may predict the disease severity in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. These changes may be related to respiratory distress in the disease.","PURPOSE: It has come to our attention that specific vascular changes (VCs) appear more frequently in chest computed tomography (CT) of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we aimed to investigate if these specific VCs in chest CT correlate with clinical severity of the disease. METHODS: CT images of 102 patients who underwent low-dose noncontrast chest CT due to COVID-19 between 11 March 2020 and 11 April 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of VCs in CT images. VCs in chest CT of patients with COVID-19 were defined using the following descriptors: decreased lumen caliber, vascular wall irregularity, angulation in the course of the vessel, vascular disruption, and/or interruption. The relationship of these VCs with disease symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath), comorbid conditions (diabetes, hypertension, asthma), smoking habit, disease-specific laboratory changes (white blood cell-lymphocyte count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein [CRP], D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ferritin, procalcitonin), lung parenchymal infiltration pattern (ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation) and its distribution (peripheral, central, mixed, upper lobes, lower lobes, right middle lobe) on CT were investigated by comparison of these variables between patients with and without VCs in chest CT.

227,33039120,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) type 2 is the receptor of SARSCoV-2 for cell entry into lung cells. Because ACE-2 may be modulated by ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), there are concern that patients treated with ACEIs and ARBs are at higher risk for COVID-19 infection or severity. This study sought to analyse the association of severe forms of COVID-19 and mortality with hypertension and a previous treatment with ACEI and ARB. METHODS: Prospective follow-up of 433 consecutive patients hospitalised for COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by PCR or highly probable on clinical, biological, and radiological findings, and included in the COVHYP study. Mortality and severe COVID-19 (criteria: death, intensive care unit, or hospitalisation >30 days) were compared in patients receiving or not ACEIs and ARBs. Follow-up was 100% at hospital discharge, and 96.5% at >1month. RESULTS: Age was 63.6+/-18.7 years, and 40%) were female. At follow-up (mean 78+/-50 days), 136 (31%) patients had severity criteria (death, 64 ; intensive care unit, 73; hospital stay >30 days, 49). Hypertension (55.1% vs 36.7%, P<0.001) and antihypertensive treatment were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. The association between ACEI/ARB treatment and COVID-19 severity criteria found in univariate analysis (Odds Ratio 1.74, 95%CI [1.14-2.64], P=0.01) was not confirmed when adjusted on age, gender, and hypertension (adjusted OR1.13 [0.59-2.15], P=0.72). Diabetes and hypothyroidism were associated with severe COVID-19, whereas history of asthma was not. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that previous treatment with ACEI and ARB is not associated with hospital mortality, 1- and 2-month mortality, and severity criteria in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. No protective effect of ACEIs and ARBs on severe pneumonia related to COVID-19 was demonstrated.","BACKGROUND AND AIM: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) type 2 is the receptor of SARSCoV-2 for cell entry into lung cells.

231,32980585,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated significantly worse outcomes for minority (black and Hispanic) individuals. Understanding the reasons for COVID-19-related disparities among patients with asthma has important public health implications. OBJECTIVE: To determine factors contributing to health disparities in those with asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous survey was sent through social media to adult patients with asthma, and a separate survey was sent to physicians who provide asthma care. The patient survey addressed demographic information including socioeconomic status, asthma control, and attitudes/health behaviors during COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 1171 patients (10.1% minority individuals) and 225 physicians completed the survey. Minority patients were more likely to have been affected by COVID-19 (eg, became unemployed, lived in a community with high COVID-19 cases). They had worse asthma control (increased emergency visits for asthma, lower Asthma Control Test score), were more likely to live in urban areas, and had a lower household income. Initial differences in attitudes and health behaviors disappeared after controlling for baseline demographic features. Institutional racism was demonstrated by findings that minority individuals were less likely to have a primary care physician, had more trouble affording asthma medications due to COVID-19, and were more likely to have lost health insurance because of COVID-19, and that 25% of physicians found it more challenging to care for black individuals with asthma during COVID-19.

232,32979987,"BACKGROUND: Early descriptions of patients admitted to hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic showed a lower prevalence of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than would be expected for an acute respiratory disease like COVID-19, leading to speculation that inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) might protect against infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or the development of serious sequelae. We assessed the association between ICS and COVID-19-related death among people with COPD or asthma using linked electronic health records (EHRs) in England, UK. METHODS: In this observational study, we analysed patient-level data for people with COPD or asthma from primary care EHRs linked with death data from the Office of National Statistics using the OpenSAFELY platform. The index date (start of follow-up) for both cohorts was March 1, 2020; follow-up lasted until May 6, 2020. For the COPD cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 35 years or older, had COPD, were a current or former smoker, and were prescribed an ICS or long-acting beta agonist plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LABA-LAMA) as combination therapy within the 4 months before the index date. For the asthma cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had been diagnosed with asthma within 3 years of the index date, and were prescribed an ICS or short-acting beta agonist (SABA) only within the 4 months before the index date. We compared the outcome of COVID-19-related death between people prescribed an ICS and those prescribed alternative respiratory medications: ICSs versus LABA-LAMA for the COPD cohort, and low-dose or medium-dose and high-dose ICSs versus SABAs only in the asthma cohort. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between exposure categories and the outcome in each population, adjusted for age, sex, and all other prespecified covariates. We calculated e-values to quantify the effect of unmeasured confounding on our results. FINDINGS: We identified 148 557 people with COPD and 818 490 people with asthma who were given relevant respiratory medications in the 4 months before the index date. People with COPD who were prescribed ICSs were at increased risk of COVID-19-related death compared with those prescribed LABA-LAMA combinations (adjusted HR 1.39 [95% CI 1.10-1.76]). Compared with those prescribed SABAs only, people with asthma who were prescribed high-dose ICS were at an increased risk of death (1.55 [1.10-2.18]), whereas those given a low or medium dose were not (1.14 [0.85-1.54]). Sensitivity analyses showed that the apparent harmful association we observed could be explained by relatively small health differences between people prescribed ICS and those not prescribed ICS that were not recorded in the database (e value lower 95% CI 1.43). INTERPRETATION: Our results do not support a major role for regular ICS use in protecting against COVID-19-related death among people with asthma or COPD. Observed increased risks of COVID-19-related death can be plausibly explained by unmeasured confounding due to disease severity.

233,32979574,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence, nature and risk factors for the main clinical sequelae in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors who have been discharged from the hospital for more than 3 months. METHODS: This longitudinal study was based on a telephone follow-up survey of COVID-19 patients hospitalized and discharged from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China before 1 March 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics and self-reported clinical sequelae of the survivors were described and analysed. A cohort of volunteers who were free of COVID-19 and lived in the urban area of Wuhan during the outbreak were also selected as the comparison group. RESULTS: Among 538 survivors (293, 54.5% female), the median (interquartile range) age was 52.0 (41.0-62.0) years, and the time from discharge from hospital to first follow-up was 97.0 (95.0-102.0) days. Clinical sequelae were common, including general symptoms (n = 267, 49.6%), respiratory symptoms (n = 210, 39%), cardiovascular-related symptoms (n = 70, 13%), psychosocial symptoms (n = 122, 22.7%) and alopecia (n = 154, 28.6%). We found that physical decline/fatigue (p < 0.01), postactivity polypnoea (p= 0.04) and alopecia (p < 0.01) were more common in female than in male subjects. Dyspnoea during hospitalization was associated with subsequent physical decline/fatigue, postactivity polypnoea and resting heart rate increases but not specifically with alopecia. A history of asthma during hospitalization was associated with subsequent postactivity polypnoea sequela. A history of pulse >/=90 bpm during hospitalization was associated with resting heart rate increase in convalescence. The duration of virus shedding after COVID-19 onset and hospital length of stay were longer in survivors with physical decline/fatigue or postactivity polypnoea than in those without. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical sequelae during early COVID-19 convalescence were common; some of these sequelae might be related to gender, age and clinical characteristics during hospitalization.","OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence, nature and risk factors for the main clinical sequelae in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors who have been discharged from the hospital for more than 3 months.

234,32978309,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide rapidly. However, the effects of asthma, asthma medication and asthma severity on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 have not yet been established. METHODS: The study included 7590 de-identified patients, who were confirmed to have COVID-19 using the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA-PCR tests conducted up to May 15, 2020; we used the linked-medical claims data provided by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. Asthma and asthma severity (steps suggested by the Global Initiative for Asthma) were defined using the diagnostic code and history of asthma medication usage. RESULTS: Among 7590 COVID-19 patients, 218 (2.9%) had underlying asthma. The total medical cost associated with COVID-19 patients with underlying asthma was significantly higher than that of other patients. Mortality rate for COVID-19 patients with underlying asthma (7.8%) was significantly higher than that of other patients (2.8%; p<0.001). However, asthma was not an independent risk factor for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 after adjustment, nor did asthma medication use and asthma severity affect the clinical outcomes of COVID-19. However, use of oral short-acting beta2-agonists was an independent factor to increase the total medical cost burden. Patients with step 5 asthma showed significant prolonged duration of admission compared to those with step 1 asthma in both univariate and multivariate analysis.

237,32952147,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and is associated with severe respiratory disease. There are extensive publications on the chest computed tomography (CT) findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, with ground-glass opacities (GGO) and mixed GGO and consolidation being the most common findings. Those with interstitial thickening manifesting as reticular opacities typically show superimposed ground-glass opacities, giving a crazy-paving pattern. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 77-year-old man with a background of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome (ACOS) who presented with progressive cough and shortness of breath for 2 days. He was in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The initial chest radiograph was negative for lung consolidation and ground-glass opacities. During admission, he had worsening shortness of breath with desaturation, prompting a chest CT examination, which was performed on day 14 of illness. The chest CT revealed an atypical finding of predominant focal subpleural interstitial thickening in the right lower lobe. He was provided supportive treatment along with steroid and antibiotics. He recovered well and subsequently tested negative for 2 consecutive swabs. He was discharged after 34 days. CONCLUSIONS Interstitial thickening or reticular pattern on CT has been described in COVID-19 pneumonia, but largely in association with ground-glass opacity or consolidation. This case demonstrates an atypical predominance of interstitial thickening on chest CT in COVID-19 pneumonia on day 14 of illness, which is the expected time of greatest severity of the disease.","BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and is associated with severe respiratory disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cohort study of a prospective registry of all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 12 and June 10, 2020 with complete followup until disease recovery or death. The main exposure examined was the use of androgen deprivation therapy, and the outcome measures were the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and disease severity as a function of androgen deprivation therapy use. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 1,779 men with prostate cancer from a total tested population of 74,787, of whom 4,885 (6.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those with prostate cancer 102 (5.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 304 (17.1%) were on androgen deprivation therapy. Among those on androgen deprivation therapy 5.6% were positive as compared to 5.8% not on androgen deprivation therapy. Men on androgen deprivation therapy were slightly older (75.5 vs 73.8 years, p=0.009), more likely to have smoked (68.1% vs 59.3%, p=0.005) and more likely to report taking steroids (43.8% vs 23.3%, p <0.001). Other factors known to increase risk of infection and disease severity were equally distributed (asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure and immune suppressive disease).

242,32835530,"INTRODUCTION: A life-threatening respiratory disease, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), has spread across the globe since December 2019. Many prognostic factors have already been put forward to predict the risk of death and other outcomes. The current study is evaluating the survival rate between hypertensive and non-hypertensive infected patients. METHODS: Patients who were included in this study were admitted between 20 February to 1 March 2020 in Fars (southwest of Iran) province hospitals. Data were collected from the electronic base registry which contained demographic information, medical symptoms, and signs, underlying diseases, CT scan results, and final outcome. RESULTS: Of all 1239 positive cases, 159 (12.83%) had known with hypertension ant this group was significantly older than non-hypertensive patients (66.1 years Vs 48.95 years, p < .001). According to Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log-rank test, it was seen hypertensive patients deteriorated more rapidly than non-hypertensive group (p = .032). Moreover, HIV, cardiovascular, and kidney disease were diagnosed as factors that increase the risk of death in hypertensive patients. CONCLUSION: The current study about the survival rate of COVID-19 patients had shown hypertensive patents are in danger of disease severity, although it may be related to their age. Moreover, the probability of other complications like diabetes, smoking, asthma, kidney, and cardiovascular diseases, and either some other infections such as HIV can make the condition complicated and need more consideration to prevent noxious outcomes.","INTRODUCTION: A life-threatening respiratory disease, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), has spread across the globe since December 2019.

244,32810517,"BACKGROUND: There is inconclusive and controversial evidence of the association between allergic diseases and the risk of adverse clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the association of allergic disorders with the likelihood of a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test result and with clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (admission to intensive care unit, administration of invasive ventilation, and death). METHODS: A propensity-score-matched nationwide cohort study was performed in South Korea. Data obtained from the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service of Korea from all adult patients (age, >20 years) who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea between January 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, were analyzed. The association of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and allergic diseases in the entire cohort (n = 219,959) and the difference in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 were evaluated in patients with allergic diseases and SARS-CoV-2 positivity (n = 7,340). RESULTS: In the entire cohort, patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing were evaluated to ascertain whether asthma and allergic rhinitis were associated with an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. After propensity score matching, we found that asthma and allergic rhinitis were associated with worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. Patients with nonallergic asthma had a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and worse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 than patients with allergic asthma. CONCLUSIONS: In a Korean nationwide cohort, allergic rhinitis and asthma, especially nonallergic asthma, confers a greater risk of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19.","BACKGROUND: There is inconclusive and controversial evidence of the association between allergic diseases and the risk of adverse clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of Science databases to identify any reported cases of maternal, fetal or neonatal mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. The references of relevant studies were also hand-searched. RESULTS: Of 2815 studies screened, 10 studies reporting 37 maternal and 12 perinatal mortality cases (7 fetal demise and 5 neonatal death) were finally eligible for inclusion to this review. All maternal deaths were seen in women with previous co-morbidities, of which the most common were obesity, diabetes, asthma and advanced maternal age. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severity of pneumonia were considered as the leading causes of all maternal mortalities, except for one case who died of thromboembolism during postpartum period. Fetal and neonatal mortalities were suggested to be a result of the severity of maternal infection or the prematurity, respectively. Interestingly, there was no evidence of vertical transmission or positive COVID-19 test result among expired neonates. CONCLUSION: Current available evidence suggested that maternal mortality mostly happened among women with previous co-morbidities and neonatal mortality seems to be a result of prematurity rather than infection. However, further reports are needed so that the magnitude of the maternal and perinatal mortality could be determined more precisely.","OBJECTIVE: This is the first comprehensive review to focus on currently available evidence regarding maternal, fetal and neonatal mortality cases associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, up to July 2020.

Some very low death rate countries such as Eastern Asia, Central Europe, or the Balkans have a common feature of eating large quantities of fermented foods. Although biases exist when examining ecological studies, fermented vegetables or cabbage have been associated with low death rates in European countries. SARS-CoV-2 binds to its receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As a result of SARS-CoV-2 binding, ACE2 downregulation enhances the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1 R) axis associated with oxidative stress. This leads to insulin resistance as well as lung and endothelial damage, two severe outcomes of COVID-19. The nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is the most potent antioxidant in humans and can block in particular the AT1 R axis. Cabbage contains precursors of sulforaphane, the most active natural activator of Nrf2. Fermented vegetables contain many lactobacilli, which are also potent Nrf2 activators. Three examples are: kimchi in Korea, westernized foods, and the slum paradox. It is proposed that fermented cabbage is a proof-of-concept of dietary manipulations that may enhance Nrf2-associated antioxidant effects, helpful in mitigating COVID-19 severity.","Large differences in COVID-19 death rates exist between countries and between regions of the same country.

We aimed at understanding the perceptions, context and attitudes of individuals with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic to clarify their potential risk of infection. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was nested in ComPaRe, an e-cohort of adults with chronic conditions, in France. It assessed participants' perception of their risk of severe illness with COVID-19; their context (i.e., work, household, contacts with external people); and their attitudes in situations involving frequent or occasional contacts with symptomatic or asymptomatic people. Data were collected from March 23 to April 2, 2020, during the lockdown in France. Analyses were weighted to represent the demographic characteristics of French patients with chronic conditions. The subgroup of participants at high risk according to the recommendations of the French High Council for Public Health was examined. RESULTS: Among the 7169 recruited participants, 63% patients felt at risk because of severe illness. About one quarter (23.7%) were at risk of infection because they worked outside home, had a household member working outside home or had regular visits from external contacts. Less than 20% participants refused contact with symptomatic people and <20% used masks when in contact with asymptomatic people. Among patients considered at high risk according to the recommendations of the French High Council for Public Health, 20% did not feel at risk, which led to incautious attitudes. CONCLUSION: Individuals with chronic conditions have distorted perceptions of their risk of severe illness with COVID-19. In addition, they are exposed to COVID-19 due to their context or attitudes.","BACKGROUND: To avoid a surge of demand on the healthcare system due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we must reduce transmission to individuals with chronic conditions who are at risk of severe illness with COVID-19.

258,32662525,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, with 10%-20% of severe cases and over 508 000 deaths worldwide. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to address the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 patients and the mortality of severe patients. METHODS: 289 hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Electronic medical records, including patient demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory tests results, and radiological materials, were collected and analyzed. According to the severity and outcomes of the patients, they were divided into three groups: nonsurvived (n = 49), survived severe (n = 78), and nonsevere (n = 162) groups. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were compared among these groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality and visualize the patients on a low-dimensional space. Correlations between clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters were investigated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to determine the risk factors associated with mortality in severe patients. Longitudinal changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay were also collected. RESULTS: Of the 289 patients, the median age was 57 years (range, 22-88) and 155 (53.4%) patients were male. As of the final follow-up date of this study, 240 (83.0%) patients were discharged from the hospital and 49 (17.0%) patients died. Elder age, underlying comorbidities, and increased laboratory variables, such as leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) on admission, were found in survived severe cases compared to nonsevere cases. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, elder age, a higher number of affected lobes, elevated CRP levels on admission, increased prevalence of chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were independent risk factors for death of severe patients. A trajectory in PCA was observed from ""nonsevere"" toward ""nonsurvived"" via ""severe and survived"" patients. Strong correlations between the age of patients, the affected lobe numbers, and laboratory variables were identified. Dynamic changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay showed that continuing increase of leukocytes and neutrophil count, sustained lymphopenia and eosinopenia, progressing decrease in platelet count, as well as high levels of NLR, CRP, PCT, AST, BUN, and serum creatinine were associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Survived severe and nonsurvived COVID-19 patients had distinct clinical and laboratory characteristics, which were separated by principle component analysis.

259,32624257,"The global pandemic caused by the newly described severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused worldwide suffering and death of unimaginable magnitude from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus is transmitted through aerosol droplets, and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain of its spike protein S1 to attach to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in lung and airway cells. Binding requires the help of another host protein, transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2. Several factors likely contribute to the efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a 10- to 20-fold higher receptor-binding capacity compared with previous pandemic coronaviruses. In addition, because asymptomatic persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 have high viral loads in their nasal secretions, they can silently and efficiently spread the disease. PCR-based tests have emerged as the criterion standard for the diagnosis of infection. Caution must be exercised in interpreting antibody-based tests because they have not yet been validated, and may give a false sense of security of being ""immune"" to SARS-CoV-2. We discuss how the development of some symptoms in allergic rhinitis can serve as clues for new-onset COVID-19. There are mixed reports that asthma is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, possibly due to differences in asthma endotypes. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has focused the efforts of scientists on repurposing existing Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs that inhibit viral entry, endocytosis, genome assembly, translation, and replication. Numerous clinical trials have been launched to identify effective treatments for COVID-19. Initial data from a placebo-controlled study suggest faster time to recovery in patients on remdesivir; it is now being evaluated in additional controlled studies.

261,32611305,"Nowadays Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) is increasing mortality all over the world mercilessly. We are learning almost every day about its new symptoms and that it mutates quickly. This disease has tied us up and made us desperate. The death rate from this disease has increased in patients who had pre-existing medical conditions, especially cardiovascular ones, by eliminating the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptor in the lungs. Also, ACE1 and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may stimulate ACE2 expression and worse the prognosis. Intravenous infusions of ACEIs and ARBs in experimental animals increase the number of ACE2 receptors.

We are learning almost every day about its new symptoms and that it mutates quickly. This disease has tied us up and made us desperate. The death rate from this disease has increased in patients who had pre-existing medical conditions, especially cardiovascular ones, by eliminating the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptor in the lungs. Also, ACE1 and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may stimulate ACE2 expression and worse the prognosis. Intravenous infusions of ACEIs and ARBs in experimental animals increase the number of ACE2 receptors.

262,32607513,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan in December 2019 became a pandemic within a few months of its discovery. The impact of COVID-19 is due to both its rapid spread and its severity, but the determinants of severity have not been fully delineated. OBJECTIVE: Identify factors associated with hospitalization and disease severity in a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We analyzed data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University of Cincinnati health system from March 13, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Severe COVID-19 was defined as admission to intensive care unit or death. Logistic regression modeling adjusted for covariates was used to identify the factors associated with hospitalization and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the 689 COVID-19 patients included in our study, 29.2% were non-Hispanic White, 25.5% were non-Hispanic Black, 32.5% were Hispanic, and 12.8% were of other race/ethnicity. About 31.3% of patients were hospitalized and 13.2% had severe disease. In adjusted analyses, the sociodemographic factors associated with hospitalization and/or disease severity included older age, non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity (compared to non-Hispanic White), and smoking. The following comorbidities: diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, asthma, COPD, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, and vitamin D deficiency were associated with hospitalization and/or disease severity. Hematological disorders such as anemia, coagulation disorders, and thrombocytopenia were associated with both hospitalization and disease severity. CONCLUSION: This study confirms race and ethnicity as predictors of severe COVID-19. It also finds clinical risk factors for hospitalization and severe COVID-19 not previously identified such a vitamin D deficiency, hypercholesterolemia, osteoarthritis, and anemia.","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan in December 2019 became a pandemic within a few months of its discovery.

263,32603901,"BACKGROUND: Viral infections are known to exacerbate asthma in adults. Previous studies have found few patients with asthma among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia cases. However, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe asthma exacerbation is not known. OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of asthma exacerbation in patients with asthma hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and compare symptoms and laboratory and radiological findings in patients with and without asthma with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: We included 106 patients between March 4 and April 6, 2020, who were hospitalized in the Chest Diseases Department of Strasbourg University Hospital; 23 had asthma. To assess the patients' asthma status, 3 periods were defined: the last month before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms (p1), prehospitalization (p2), and during hospitalization (p3). Severe asthma exacerbations were defined according to Global INitiative for Asthma guidelines during p1 and p2. During p3, we defined severe asthma deterioration as the onset of breathlessness and wheezing requiring systemic corticosteroids and inhaled beta2 agonist. RESULTS: We found no significant difference between patients with and without asthma in terms of severity (length of stay, maximal oxygen flow needed, noninvasive ventilation requirement, and intensive care unit transfer); 52.2% of the patients with asthma had Global INitiative for Asthma step 1 asthma. One patient had a severe exacerbation during p1, 2 patients during p2, and 5 patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids and inhaled beta2 agonist during p3. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that patients with asthma appeared not to be at risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia did not induce severe asthma exacerbation.","BACKGROUND: Viral infections are known to exacerbate asthma in adults.

267,32561497,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether asthma may affect susceptibility or severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children and how pediatric asthma services worldwide have responded to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric asthma services and on disease burden in their patients. METHODS: An online survey was sent to members of the Pediatric Asthma in Real Life think tank and the World Allergy Organization Pediatric Asthma Committee. It included questions on service provision, disease burden, and the clinical course of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection among children with asthma. RESULTS: Ninety-one respondents, caring for an estimated population of more than 133,000 children with asthma, completed the survey. COVID-19 significantly impacted pediatric asthma services: 39% ceased physical appointments, 47% stopped accepting new patients, and 75% limited patients' visits. Consultations were almost halved to a median of 20 (interquartile range, 10-25) patients per week. Virtual clinics and helplines were launched in most centers. Better than expected disease control was reported in 20% (10%-40%) of patients, whereas control was negatively affected in only 10% (7.5%-12.5%). Adherence also appeared to increase. Only 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported among the population; the estimated incidence is not apparently different from the reports of general pediatric cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Children with asthma do not appear to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Outcomes may even have improved, possibly through increased adherence and/or reduced exposures. Clinical services have rapidly responded to the pandemic by limiting and replacing physical appointments with virtual encounters.","BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether asthma may affect susceptibility or severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children and how pediatric asthma services worldwide have responded to the pandemic.

268,32558360,"RATIONALE: Whether asthma constitutes a risk factor for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. Here, we aimed to assess whether asthma, the most common chronic disease in children, is associated with higher COVID-19 risk or severity in pediatric populations. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in three stages: first, we reviewed PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL for systematic reviews of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 in pediatric populations, and reviewed their primary articles; second, we searched PubMed for studies on COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 and asthma/wheeze, and evaluated whether the resulting studies included pediatric populations; third, we repeated the second search in BioRxiv.org and MedRxiv.org to find pre-prints that may have information on pediatric asthma. RESULTS: In the first search, eight systematic reviews were found, of which five were done in pediatric populations; none of the 67 primary studies included data on pediatric asthma as a comorbidity for COVID-19. In the second search, we found 34 results in PubMed, of which five reported asthma in adults, but none included data on children. In the third search, 25 pre-prints in MedRxiv included data on asthma, but none on children.

269,32554337,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Since the initial anecdotal reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from China, a growing number of studies have reported on smell and/or taste dysfunction (STD). Objective: The aim of our study was to investigate the frequency and severity of STD in COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the association with demographic characteristics, hospital admission, symptoms, comorbidities, and blood biomarkers. METHODS: We performed a multicenter cross-sectional study on patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (n=846) and controls (n=143) from 15 Spanish hospitals. Data on STD were collected prospectively using an in-person survey. The severity of STD was categorized using a visual analog scale. We analyzed time to onset, recovery rate, time to recovery, hospital admission, pneumonia, comorbidities, smoking, and symptoms. RESULTS: STD was at least 2-fold more common in COVID-19-positive patients than in controls. COVID-19-positive hospitalized patients were older, with a lower frequency of STD, and recovered earlier than outpatients. Analysis stratified by severity of STD showed that more than half of COVID-19 patients presented severe loss of smell (53.7%) or taste (52.2%); both senses were impaired in >90%. In the multivariate analysis, older age (>60 years), being hospitalized, and increased C-reactive protein were associated with a better sense of smell and/or taste. COVID-19-positive patients reported improvement in smell (45.6%) and taste (46.1%) at the time of the survey; in 90.6% this was within 2 weeks of infection. CONCLUSION: STD is a common symptom in COVID-19 and presents mainly in young and nonhospitalized patients.

270,32554082,"BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises that patients with moderate to severe asthma belong to a high-risk group that is susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the association between asthma and COVID-19 has not been well-established. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to determine the prevalence of asthma among patients with COVID-19 in a major US health system. We assessed the clinical characteristics and comorbidities in asthmatic and nonasthmatic patients with COVID-19. We also determined the risk of hospitalization associated with asthma and/or inhaled corticosteroid use. METHODS: Medical records of patients with COVID-19 were searched by a computer algorithm (March 1 to April 15, 2020), and chart review was used to validate the diagnosis of asthma and medications prescribed for asthma. All patients had PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Demographic and clinical features were characterized. Regression models were used to assess the associations between asthma and corticosteroid use and the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 1526 patients identified with COVID-19, 220 (14%) were classified as having asthma. Asthma was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (relative risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77-1.19) after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. The ongoing use of inhaled corticosteroids did not increase the risk of hospitalization in a similar adjusted model (relative risk, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.90-2.15). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a substantial prevalence of asthma in our COVID-19 cohort, asthma was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization.

272,32531372,"BACKGROUND: More than 300 million people carry a diagnosis of asthma, with data to suggest that they are at a higher risk for infection or adverse outcomes from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Asthma is remarkably heterogeneous, and it is currently unclear how patient-intrinsic factors may relate to coronavirus disease 2019. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify and characterize subsets of patients with asthma at increased risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. METHODS: Participants from 2 large asthma cohorts were stratified using clinically relevant parameters to identify factors related to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) expression within bronchial epithelium. ACE-2-correlated gene signatures were used to interrogate publicly available databases to identify upstream signaling events and novel therapeutic targets. RESULTS: Stratifying by type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, we identified subjects who demonstrated low peripheral blood eosinophils accompanied by increased expression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 receptor ACE2 in bronchial epithelium. Genes highly correlated with ACE2 overlapped with type 1 and 2 IFN signatures, normally induced by viral infections. T-cell recruitment and activation within bronchoalveolar lavage cells of ACE2-high subjects was reciprocally increased. These patients demonstrated characteristics corresponding to risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019, including male sex, history of hypertension, low peripheral blood, and elevated bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 expression is linked to upregulation of viral response genes in a subset of type 2-low patients with asthma with characteristics resembling known risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019. Therapies targeting the IFN family and T-cell-activating factors may therefore be of benefit in a subset of patients.","BACKGROUND: More than 300 million people carry a diagnosis of asthma, with data to suggest that they are at a higher risk for infection or adverse outcomes from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

273,32524611,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has made widespread impact recently. We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 children with different severities and allergic status. METHODS: Data extracted from the electronic medical records, including demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, laboratory and immunological results, and radiological images of 182 hospitalized COVID-19 children, were summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 6 years, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there were more boys (male-female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients. Most of the children were infected by family members. Fever (43.4%) and dry cough (44.5%) were common symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for 11.0%, including diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. 71.4% had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were ground-glass opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission. Laboratory results were mostly within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%) and eosinopenia (29.5%) were observed. The majority (97.8%) of infected children were not severe, and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomatic infections. Compared to children without pneumonia (manifested as asymptomatic and acute upper respiratory infection), children with pneumonia were associated with higher percentages of the comorbidity history, symptoms of fever and cough, and increased levels of serum procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum interleukins (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha. There were no differences in treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from first positive to first negative nucleic acid testing, and outcomes between children with mild pneumonia and without pneumonia. All the hospitalized COVID-19 children had recovered except one death due to intussusception and sepsis. In 43 allergic children with COVID-19, allergic rhinitis (83.7%) was the major disease, followed by drug allergy, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and asthma. Demographics and clinical features were not significantly different between allergic and nonallergic groups. Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared with all patients. Immunological profiles including circulating T, B, and NK lymphocyte subsets, total immunoglobulin and complement levels, and serum cytokines did not show any difference in allergic and pneumonia groups. Neither eosinophil counts nor serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels showed a significant correlation with other immunological measures, such as other immunoglobulins, complements, lymphocyte subset numbers, and serum cytokine levels. CONCLUSION: Pediatric COVID-19 patients tended to have a mild clinical course. Patients with pneumonia had higher proportion of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers than those without pneumonia. There was no difference between allergic and nonallergic COVID-19 children in disease incidence, clinical features, and laboratory and immunological findings. Allergy was not a risk factor for developing and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hardly influenced the disease course of COVID-19 in children.","BACKGROUND: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has made widespread impact recently.

275,32522282,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this randomised GCP-controlled trial is to clarify whether combination therapy with the antibiotic azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine via anti-inflammation/immune modulation, antiviral efficacy and pre-emptive treatment of supra-infections can shorten hospitalisation duration for patients with COVID-19 (measured as ""days alive and out of hospital"" as the primary outcome), reduce the risk of non- invasive ventilation, treatment in the intensive care unit and death. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a multi-centre, randomised, Placebo-controlled, 2-arm ratio 1:1, parallel group double-blind study. PARTICIPANTS: 226 participants are recruited at the trial sites/hospitals, where the study will take place in Denmark: Aalborg, Bispebjerg, Gentofte, Herlev, Hillerod, Hvidovre, Odense and Slagelse hospitals. INCLUSION CRITERIA: * Patient admitted to Danish emergency departments, respiratory medicine departments or internal medicine departments * Age>/= 18 years * Hospitalized </=48 hours * Positive COVID-19 test / diagnosis during the hospitalization (confirmed). * Men or non-fertile women. Fertile women* must not be pregnant, i.e. negative pregnancy test must be available at inclusion * Informed consent signed by the patient *Defined as after menarche and until postmenopausal (no menstruation for 12 months) Exclusion criteria: * At the time of recruitment, the patient uses >5 LO2/min (equivalent to 40% FiO2 if measured) * Known intolerance/allergy to azithromycin or hydroxychloroquine or hypersensitivity to quinine or 4-aminoquinoline derivatives * Neurogenic hearing loss * Psoriasis * Retinopathy * Maculopathy * Visual field changes * Breastfeeding * Severe liver diseases other than amoebiasis (INR> 1.5 spontaneously) * Severe gastrointestinal, neurological and hematological disorders (investigator-assessed) * eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 * Clinically significant cardiac conduction disorders/arrhythmias or prolonged QTc interval (QTc (f) of> 480/470 ms). * Myasthenia gravis * Treatment with digoxin* * Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency * Porphyria * Hypoglycaemia (Blood glucose at any time since hospitalization of <3.0 mmol/L) * Severe mental illness which significantly impedes cooperation * Severe linguistic problems that significantly hinder cooperation * Treatment with ergot alkaloids *The patient must not be treated with digoxin for the duration of the intervention. For atrial fibrillation/flutter, select according to the Cardiovascular National Treatment Guide (NBV): Calcium antagonist, Beta blocker, direct current (DC) conversion or amiodarone. In case of urgent need for digoxin treatment (contraindication for the aforementioned equal alternatives), the test drug should be paused, and ECG should be taken daily. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Control group: The control group will receive the standard treatment + placebo for both types of intervention medication at all times. If part or all the intervention therapy being investigated becomes standard treatment during the study, this may also be offered to the control group. Intervention group: The patients in the intervention group will also receive standard care. Immediately after randomisation to the intervention group, the patient will begin treatment with: Azithromycin: Day 1-3: 500 mg x 1 Day 4-15: 250 mg x 1 If the patient is unable to take the medication orally by themselves, the medication will, if possible, be administered by either stomach-feeding tube, or alternatively, temporary be changed to clarithromycin 500 mg x 2 (this only in agreement with either study coordinator Pradeesh Sivapalan or principal investigator Jens-Ulrik Staehr Jensen). This will also be done in the control group if necessary. The patient will switch back to azithromycin when possible.

276,32519921,"INTRODUCTION: Only little is known about COVID-19 in patients with asthma. There is no data on COVID-19 in patients with severe asthma or patients with asthma who are treated with monoclonal antibodies. CASE STUDY: Here, we present the case of a severe eosinophilic asthmatic in whom benralizumab treatment, an anti-IL-5R monoclonal antibody, was initiated 2 years ago. Prior to benralizumab treatment, every viral infection had resulted in a prolonged course of oral corticosteroids (OCS). Since initiation of benralizumab, the patient has had good asthma control. Mid-March 2020, the patient developed high fever. RESULTS: A SARS-CoV-2-PCR (nasopharyngeal swab) was positive. The patient's symptoms subsided after few days. No OCS was needed. The asthma control questionnaire 6-item scale worsened moderately in the week of the infection and returned to normal levels thereafter. The asthma control test, measuring longer term asthma control, showed no decline. CONCLUSION: The course of COVID-19 was very mild in this particular patient with severe eosinophilic asthma. So far, there is no evidence that would suggest a more severe course of COVID-19 in patients with asthma. It is worth noting, that prior to the initiation of benralizumab this patient had multiple exacerbations per year triggered by viral infections (4/year), which all required OCS. Whilst only anecdotal, this case study provides the first evidence to support the current recommendation of continuing monoclonal antibodies in patients with severe asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic.","INTRODUCTION: Only little is known about COVID-19 in patients with asthma.

277,32516795,"Even though respiratory viruses are one of the most common triggers for asthma exacerbations, not all of these viruses affect patients equally. There is no strong evidence supporting that patients with asthma have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill from coronavirus disease 2019 (CO-VID-19), although recent reports from the USA and the UK suggest that asthma is much more common in children and adults with mild to severe COVID-19 than has previously been reported in Asia and in Europe. As in previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks, patients with asthma, especially children, appear to be less susceptible to the coronavirus with a low rate of asthma exacerbations. A different expression of viral receptors and T2 inflammation can be responsible for different outcomes. Future studies focused on asthma and on other allergic disorders are needed to provide a greater understanding of the impact of underlying asthma and allergic inflammation on COVID-19 susceptibility and disease severity. However, for the moment, it is crucial that asthmatic patients maintain their controller medication, from inhaled corticosteroids to biologics, without making any dose adjustments on their own or stopping the medication.

279,32496587,"BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is accelerating worldwide, and novel clinical presentations of COVID-19 are often reported. The range of human cells and tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, its potential receptors and associated regulating factors are still largely unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of known and potential SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related molecules in the extensive collection of primary human cells and tissues from healthy subjects of different age and from patients with risk factors and known comorbidities of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing and explored available RNA-Seq databases to study gene expression and co-expression of ACE2, CD147 (BSG), and CD26 (DPP4) and their direct and indirect molecular partners in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial and skin biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, neutrophils, DCs, NK cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, B cells, and plasmablasts. We analyzed the material from healthy children and adults, and from adults in relation to their disease or COVID-19 risk factor status. RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA andPPIB), CD26 (DPP4), and related molecules were expressed in both epithelium and in immune cells. We also observed a distinct age-related expression profile of these genes in the PBMCs and T cells from healthy children and adults. Asthma, COPD, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and male gender status generally led to the higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the bronchial biopsy, BAL, or blood. Additionally, CD147-related genes correlated positively with age and BMI. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression of CD147-related genes in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest different receptor repertoire potentially involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection at the epithelial barriers and in the immune cells. Altered expression of these receptors related to age, gender, obesity and smoking, as well as with the disease status, might contribute to COVID-19 morbidity and severity patterns.","BACKGROUND: Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is accelerating worldwide, and novel clinical presentations of COVID-19 are often reported.

280,32492562,"It is widely believed that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers a disproportionate immune response which causes a devastating systemic injury, particularly in individuals with obesity, itself a chronic, multi-organ inflammatory disease. Immune cells accumulate in visceral adipose tissue and together with paracrine adipocytes release a wide range of biologically active cytokines (including IL-1beta, IL5, IL6 and IL8) that can result in both local, pulmonary and systemic inflammation. A more intense 'cytokine storm' is postulated as the mechanism behind the extreme immune response seen in severe COVID-19. It is striking how dangerous the combination of obesity and COVID-19 is, resulting in a greater risk of ICU admission and a higher mortality. Furthermore, patients from a BAME background appear to have increased mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection; they also have a higher prevalence of central obesity and its metabolic complications. In the absence of an effective vaccine, the therapeutic potential of immune-modulating drugs is a priority, but the development of new drugs is expensive and time-consuming. A more pragmatic solution would be to seek to repurpose existing drugs, particularly those that might suppress the heightened cytokine activity seen in obesity, the major risk factor for a poor prognosis in COVID-19. Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist licensed to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis. It has been shown to diminish pulmonary response to antigen, tissue eosinophilia and IL-5 expression in inflammatory cells. It has also been shown to decrease elevated levels of IL-1beta and IL8 in humans with viral upper respiratory tract infections compared with placebo-treated patients. In addition, in silico studies have demonstrated a high binding affinity of the montelukast molecule to the terminal site of the virus's main protease enzyme which is needed for virus RNA synthesis and replication. Montelukast, which is cheap, safe and widely available would appear to have the potential to be an ideal candidate drug for clinical trials, particularly in early stage disease before irreparable tissue damage has already occurred. HYPOTHESIS: Through a direct anti-viral effect, or by suppression of heightened cytokine release in response to SARS-CoV-2, montelukast will reduce the severity of immune-mediated multiorgan damage resulting from COVID-19, particularly in patients with central obesity and metabolic syndrome.","It is widely believed that infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers a disproportionate immune response which causes a devastating systemic injury, particularly in individuals with obesity, itself a chronic, multi-organ inflammatory disease.

281,32491091,"OBJECTIVE To estimate the proportion and total number of the general adult population who may be at higher risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil. METHODS We included 51,770 participants from a nationally representative, household-based health survey (PNS) conducted in Brazil. We estimated the proportion and number of adults (>/= 18 years) at risk of severe Covid-19 by sex, educational level, race/ethnicity, and state based on the presence of one or more of the following risk factors: age >/= 65 years or medical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, stroke, chronic kidney disease and moderate to severe asthma, smoking status, and obesity. RESULTS Adults at risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil varied from 34.0% (53 million) to 54.5% (86 million) nationwide. Less-educated adults present a 2-fold higher prevalence of risk factors compared to university graduated. We found no differences by sex and race/ethnicity. Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul were the most vulnerable states in absolute and relative terms of adults at risk. CONCLUSIONS Proportion and total number of adults at risk of severe Covid-19 are high in Brazil, with wide variation across states and adult subgroups. These findings should be considered while designing and implementing prevention measures in Brazil. We argue that these results support broad social isolation measures, particularly when testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 is limited.","OBJECTIVE To estimate the proportion and total number of the general adult population who may be at higher risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil.

284,32459701,"OBJECTIVE: To characterize symptoms and disease severity among pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, along with laboratory findings, imaging, and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Pregnant women with COVID-19 infection were identified at two affiliated hospitals in New York City from March 13 to April 19, 2020, for this case series study. Women were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection based on either universal testing on admission or testing because of COVID-19-related symptoms. Disease was classified as either 1) asymptomatic or mild or 2) moderate or severe based on dyspnea, tachypnea, or hypoxia. Clinical and demographic risk factors for moderate or severe disease were analyzed and calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Laboratory findings and associated symptoms were compared between those with mild or asymptomatic and moderate or severe disease. The clinical courses and associated complications of women hospitalized with moderate and severe disease are described. RESULTS: Of 158 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection, 124 (78%) had mild or asymptomatic disease and 34 (22%) had moderate or severe disease. Of 15 hospitalized women with moderate or severe disease, 10 received respiratory support with supplemental oxygen and one required intubation. Women with moderate or severe disease had a higher likelihood of having an underlying medical comorbidity (50% vs 27%, OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.26-6.02). Asthma was more common among those with moderate or severe disease (24% vs 8%, OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.26-9.75). Women with moderate or severe disease were significantly more likely to have leukopenia and elevated aspartate transaminase and ferritin. Women with moderate or severe disease were at significantly higher risk for cough and chest pain and pressure. Nine women received ICU or step-down-level care, including four for 9 days or longer. Two women underwent preterm delivery because their clinical status deteriorated.

286,32424571,"The World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control suggest that individuals over the age of 70 years or with underlying cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or diabetes are at increased risk of severe COVID-19. However, the prevalence of these prognostic factors is unknown in many countries. We aimed to describe the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors of severe COVID-19 at national and county level in Sweden. We calculated the burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on records from the Swedish national health care and population registers for 3 years before 1st January 2016. 9,624,428 individuals were included in the study population. 22.1% had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). We show that one in five individuals in Sweden is at increased risk of severe COVID-19. When compared with the critical care capacity at a local and national level, these results can aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the current pandemic. Findings can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning.","The World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control suggest that individuals over the age of 70 years or with underlying cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or diabetes are at increased risk of severe COVID-19.

The prevalence of underlying medical conditions ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). We show that one in five individuals in Sweden is at increased risk of severe COVID-19.

288,32407255,"Background Chest radiography has not been validated for its prognostic utility in evaluating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Purpose To analyze the prognostic value of a chest radiograph severity scoring system for younger (nonelderly) patients with COVID-19 at initial presentation to the emergency department (ED); outcomes of interest included hospitalization, intubation, prolonged stay, sepsis, and death. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients between the ages of 21 and 50 years who presented to the ED of an urban multicenter health system from March 10 to March 26, 2020, with COVID-19 confirmation on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were identified. Each patient's ED chest radiograph was divided into six zones and examined for opacities by two cardiothoracic radiologists, and scores were collated into a total concordant lung zone severity score. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between clinical parameters, chest radiograph scores, and patient outcomes. Results The study included 338 patients: 210 men (62%), with median age of 39 years (interquartile range, 31-45 years). After adjustment for demographics and comorbidities, independent predictors of hospital admission (n = 145, 43%) were chest radiograph severity score of 2 or more (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.5, 11; P < .001) and obesity (odds ratio, 2.4 [95% CI: 1.1, 5.4] or morbid obesity). Among patients who were admitted, a chest radiograph score of 3 or more was an independent predictor of intubation (n = 28) (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI: 1.8, 13; P = .002) as was hospital site. No significant difference was found in primary outcomes across race and ethnicity or those with a history of tobacco use, asthma, or diabetes mellitus type II.

289,32396996,"As a zoonotic disease that has already spread globally to several million human beings and possibly to domestic and wild animals, eradication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears practically impossible. There is a pressing need to improve our understanding of the immunology of this disease to contain the pandemic by developing vaccines and medicines for the prevention and treatment of patients. In this review, we aim to improve our understanding on the immune response and immunopathological changes in patients linked to deteriorating clinical conditions such as cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, autopsy findings and changes in acute-phase reactants, and serum biochemistry in COVID-19. Similar to many other viral infections, asymptomatic disease is present in a significant but currently unknown fraction of the affected individuals. In the majority of the patients, a 1-week, self-limiting viral respiratory disease typically occurs, which ends with the development of neutralizing antiviral T cell and antibody immunity. The IgM-, IgA-, and IgG-type virus-specific antibodies levels are important measurements to predict population immunity against this disease and whether cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses is taking place. High viral load during the first infection and repeated exposure to virus especially in healthcare workers can be an important factor for severity of disease. It should be noted that many aspects of severe patients are unique to COVID-19 and are rarely observed in other respiratory viral infections, such as severe lymphopenia and eosinopenia, extensive pneumonia and lung tissue damage, a cytokine storm leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure. Lymphopenia causes a defect in antiviral and immune regulatory immunity. At the same time, a cytokine storm starts with extensive activation of cytokine-secreting cells with innate and adaptive immune mechanisms both of which contribute to a poor prognosis. Elevated levels of acute-phase reactants and lymphopenia are early predictors of high disease severity. Prevention of development to severe disease, cytokine storm, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and novel approaches to prevent their development will be main routes for future research areas. As we learn to live amidst the virus, understanding the immunology of the disease can assist in containing the pandemic and in developing vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat individual patients.","As a zoonotic disease that has already spread globally to several million human beings and possibly to domestic and wild animals, eradication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears practically impossible.

291,32294485,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak occurred in Wuhan. Data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 are limited. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020, to February 5, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients. RESULTS: We identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission. Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission. The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan. The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period. Survival analysis revealed that male sex, older age, leukocytosis, high lactate dehydrogenase level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with older age, hypertension, and high lactate dehydrogenase level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19. Severe male patients with heart injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use may have a high risk of death.","BACKGROUND: In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak occurred in Wuhan.

294,32077115,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread. We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community-acquired cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) patients and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .486, P < .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P < .001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients (all P < .001). CONCLUSION: Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older age, high number of comorbidities, and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread.

Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .486, P < .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P < .001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients (all P < .001). CONCLUSION: Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older age, high number of comorbidities, and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.",Zhang JJ, C,Journal Article," BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019<br>(COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome<br>coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely<br>spread.
